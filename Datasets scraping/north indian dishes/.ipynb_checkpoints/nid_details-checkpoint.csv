Add water and stir well.Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are undercooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more. The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for kidney beans too. Keep the cooked lentils and beans aside.In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a fine and smooth puree.

Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmering on low heat.When simmering you can add more water if the consistency looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low heat.

Or else you can serve Dal Makhani straightaway.Dhungar Method (Optional)Turn on the stovetop and set the flame to low or medium-low heat. Place a flameproof wire rack with a handle on the stove. I typically use a round metal rack as shown in the step-by-step image above.Keep a small piece of charcoal on the rack and heat it directly over the flame until it becomes hot. Use steel tongs to rotate the charcoal, ensuring it burns evenly.Be cautious while doing this, and if you're unsure, it's okay to skip this step altogether.Keep the red hot charcoal in a small bowl.Pour ½ teaspoon oil on the hot charcoal.Immediately keep this bowl on top of the dal makhani.Cover for a minute and allow the charcoal to infuse its smoke in the dal makhni. Remove the bowl. Stir again.

If it does break, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of cornflour (cornstarch) as a binder. Mix the binder in well, then shape into koftas.The kofta should also come up swiftly yet gradually in the hot oil. This means the oil is hot enough for the kofta to be fried. If it browns too quickly, the oil is very hot and if the kofta remains at the bottom, the oil is warm. Carefully add the paneer kofta to the hot oil, being careful not to spatter the oil. The oil should be medium hot and have a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees Celsius (356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).When one side becomes golden, gently turn over with a slotted spoon and fry the second side.

It will again return to a liquid state.FryingMeanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till its medium hot. Lower the flame and wait for a minute. Then gently place the dough balls in the oil.Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the  jamun are evenly browned.Remove the fried jamun and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.Making gulab jamunThen place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup.

35,Baingan Bharta Recipe (Smoky Indian Mashed Eggplant),"Baingan Bharta is a smoky and flavorful North Indian dish made with fire-roasted eggplant mashed and cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic, green chilies, and spices. This rustic, comforting recipe is a Punjabi classic, usually served hot with roti or paratha.",20minutes,10minutes,30minutes,2,,Side Dish,"Indian, North Indian, Punjabi","Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian",▢ 1 eggplant – large purple variety known as bhartha baingan in India (aubergine or brinjal)▢ ½ cup or 1 medium sized onions  – finely chopped▢ 1 cup or 2 medium sized tomatoes  – finely chopped▢ 1 heaped teaspoon garlic – finely chopped or 5 to 6 medium-sized garlic cloves▢ ½  teaspoon green chillies – chopped or serrano pepper▢ ¼ teaspoon Red Chili Powder or cayenne or add as required▢ 2 tablespoons oil – can use mustard oil or peanut oil or sunflower oil▢ 1 tablespoon coriander leaves – chopped (cilantro)▢ salt as required,"Roasting EggplantRinse the eggplant in water and then pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Cut the eggplant from its base up-to an inch away from the stem without breaking it apart.Cut on four sides or directions as shown in the step-by-step guide above. The eggplant has to be whole when you place it on the stove-top.Pull apart the cut sides gently and check for worms or any black spots. Discard the eggplant if you see any worms in it.If the eggplant looks clean and without worms, then proceed further. Optionally you can spread a light layer of oil all over it. Keep it for roasting on direct flame on the stove-top. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium.Note that as the eggplant cooks some of the juices and drippings will fall which you can wipe later. I don’t recommend placing or covering the sides of the stove-top burner with aluminum foil as they can burn and be dangerous.You can also grill the eggplant in the oven. But then do note that you won’t get the smoky flavor in the eggplant.Secure the eggplant between tongs and keep on turning it after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that it is evenly cooked.Roast the eggplant till its completely cooked and tender. With a fork or knife check the doneness. The knife should slide easily in aubergine without any resistance. Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools.Smoking Eggplant (Optional Step)You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the eggplant. This is an optional step. Use natural charcoal for this method. Carefully heat a small piece of charcoal on flame with the help of tongs or by placing it in a wired metal fire-proof rack above the flame, till it becomes smoking hot and red.Make small cuts on the roasted eggplant with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 1.5 minutes. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is cooked, just like the way we do for dal tadka.Whether you have charcoal smoked the eggplant or not, peel the charred skin when it cools. Chop finely or you can even mash it.Making Baingan ka BhartaIn a kadai or frying pan or skillet, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.Stirring often, sauté the onions till they soften and translucent. Don't brown them.Add chopped green chillies and chopped tomatoes. Mix well.Sauté the tomatoes stirring often, till the oil starts separating from the mixture.The tomatoes should become pulpy, soft and oil should release from the masala mixture. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix again.Add the chopped or mashed eggplant. Mix thoroughly.Season with salt. Stirring often saute for some 4 to 5 minutes on low to medium-low heat.Finally stir in the coriander leaves or garnish bharta with them. Serve baingan bharta with phulka, roti or chapati. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.You can also pair it with any North Indian meal or mains.

This step is optional but does help in getting rid of any moisture from the spices and salt.Later, take the fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds in a dry grinder jar or a spice-grinder and grind to a coarse mixture.Rinse and wipe the raw mangoes and let them dry naturally. You can even wipe them dry with a clean kitchen towel. Making Pickle Masala MixtureChop the mangoes into 1.5 inches pieces. and add them in a bowl. Discard the stones but do peel off the flesh from the stones, if any. No need to remove the outer skin of the mangoes if they are soft and tender. Take the chopped mangoes in a large non-reactive mixing bowl. Now begin by adding the ground fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds first.Then, add fennel seeds, nigella seeds or onion seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder and salt. With a steel or wooden spoon, mix very well so that the spices uniformly coat the mango pieces. Check the taste of the pickle masala mixture or 1 to 2 mango pieces. The taste should be slightly salty. If not, then add some more salt. Next pour ½ cup mustard oil and mix very well.Spoon the prepared pickle mixture in a clean ceramic jar or glass jar. Use a clean spoon.Making Mango PickleCover with a lid and keep in sunlight for 3 to 4 days.Note that the sunlight should be very good with the strong rays falling on the pickle jar. It should not be cloudy or dark.Everyday after sun-drying in the evening, open the lid and give a gentle mix to the pickle with a clean spoon. Take the mango pieces settled at the bottom upwards in the jar and give a thorough mix. Basically, mixing and tossing needs to be done everyday. In the evening, get the jar inside and keep in a cool dry place. Next morning, keep in the sunlight again.After keeping in sunlight for 3 to 4 days, add the remaining 2.5 cups mustard oil. Again with a clean spoon, mix very well. The oil should seep inside and reach the bottom of the jar. All the mango pieces should be surrounded with some oil.You can add more mustard oil if required.Note that you do not need to heat the mustard oil.Do keep in mind that the mustard oil should float above the pickle by 2 to 3 inches. Always remember to keep the oil floating above the pickle.Seal tightly with a lid, keep in a cool dry place for 4 days until everything gets mellowed and pickled.Initially, you may find a slight bitter taste in the pickle, but after 6 to 7 days, the bitterness will go away.Storage SuggestionsThis Mango Pickle stays good for more than a year at room temperature without refrigeration.Store the mango pickle in a clean, dry, sterilized glass or ceramic jar. Always ensure a layer of oil floats above the pickle to preserve it.

Add milk to the pot.Then begin to heat the milk on a medium-low heat.Stir occasionally so that the skin does not form on the surface and also so that the milk does not get burnt from the bottom.Meanwhile, take a pan or a bowl. Place a strainer on the pan. Line the strainer with clean muslin or cheesecloth or cotton napkin. You can even line the pan directly with the muslin.Adding food acidWhen the milk starts boiling, add the lemon juice or vinegar. Begin to stir. The milk has to curdle completely. Stir the milk when it is curdling so that the curdled milk does not stick to the base of the pan.Sometimes you will see the milk has curdled partly but no watery whey can be seen. In this case also add 1 to 2 teaspoons more of the food acid and stir again. You should see the greenish colored whey in the milk.After the milk has curdled completely and you see the greenish whey, switch off the heat and then immediately pour the entire mixture in the strainer lined with the muslin, cheesecloth or cotton napkin.Carefully gather the edges of the muslin as the coagulated milk mixture will be very hot. While doing this more of the whey will be strained.Run some clean fresh water on the gathered muslin all over.Making paneerWith the ends tightly gathered, run clean, fresh water all over the cloth to rinse.Keep a heavy weight on top of the muslin or cheesecloth for 30 to 40 minutes. Use a heavy object having 500 to 600 grams weight. You can even hang the muslin bundle for an hour on your kitchen basin faucet if not using a heavyweight object.Some more whey will be strained when you place the heavyweight object. So remove the whey from the plate. After 30 to 40 minutes the paneer will set. Once warm or cooled cut homemade paneer into cubes or any shape.You can also refrigerate the paneer. Keep it in an air tight container or immerse the paneer block in a bowl of water and keep in the fridge.Homemade paneer stays fresh for 2 to 3 days in the fridge in an air-tight container. You can slice the paneer cheese later and use it any recipe.",NutritionServing: 50grams | Calories: 145kcal | Carbohydrates: 1g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Cholesterol: 33mg | Sodium: 13mg | Calcium: 240mg

Keep the sugar solution aside.)Making boondiMake a smooth flowing batter of the gram flour/besan, crushed saffron and water. The batter should neither be thick nor thin. It should be a flowing batter without any lumps. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of the the gram flour. So you can add more or less than what is mentioned in the recipe.Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil has to be moderately hot. Take a perforated ladle/spoon. With your hands position the ladle above the oil. You will need one more large ladle/jhara to remove the fried boondis.Take a large spoon of the besan batter and pour it on perforated ladle/spoon. Press with the other spoon so that the batter falls down from the perforations into the hot oil.Fry the boondi (gram flour balls) till they become golden. Don’t over fry or make them crisp. When the oil stops sizzling, remove the boondis. About 45 seconds to 1 minute is enough to get the correct texture in the boondi.This step is important because if boondi becomes crisp then motichur laddu won't be soft and they won't be able to absorb the sugar syrup.Making motichoor ladooFor collecting the fried boondi use a large slotted spoon/jhara. Drain the oil very well after removing the boondi and then add them directly to the sugar syrup. Also note that the sugar syrup should be hot.If the sugar syrup is not hot, then just heat it. In case, the sugar syrup crystallizes, then reheat again mixing 1 to 2 tablespoons water. No need to bother about the tailed or flat boondis as we will be pulsing them in the blender later.Make all the boondis like this and keep on adding them immediately to the sugar syrup.

Soak for about 2 to 3 minutes, later draining all the water. Soak the leaves in clean water for a couple of minutes. Swish and move the leaves gently with your fingers. This removes any soil or mud particles that are on the stems or leaves.Drain the water again. You can repeat this process of soaking and draining once or twice or choose to thoroughly rinse the leaves under running water for a few times. Finally, drain the water well. Place the leaves on a kitchen towel and spread them evenly on it for a few minutes or you can proceed to chopping them.Kneading DoughIn a bowl mix the whole wheat flour and salt. Add the chopped methi leaves, green chilies, garlic, oil and mix again. Pour water little by little and mix the dough first. Later knead to a smooth and soft dough adding water as needed.  Note that the water proportion will vary with the water content in the fenugreek leaves and the type, variety of wheat flour.Tip 1: If the dough looks sticky, add a few tablespoons of whole wheat flour and knead again.Tip 2: If the dough looks dry or dense, add a couple of tablespoons of water and continue to knead.Rolling doughPinch medium sized balls from the dough. Roll them between your palms to make a neat round ball. Flatten the dough ball and dust it lightly with some flour and the rolling board as well. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into medium sized roti or circle having 7 to 8 inches diameter. For a flaky, crispy layered paratha, spread ghee all over and fold twice into a triangle shape. Then roll them to a large triangle shaped dough sprinkling flour lightly.The layering method with ghee adds more fat in your parathas, but if you want a simple lighter version, then roll them plain with brushing any ghee on the dough as done in this recipe.RoastingHeat a skillet or tawa on medium-high to high heat. Place the rolled methi paratha on a hot tawa or griddle.Tip: To check the hotness of the skillet, sprinkle a pinch of flour on it. If the flour browns in a few seconds, the skillet is hot enough for roasting paratha.Wipe this roasted flour on the skillet with a kitchen napkin before placing the paratha on it.When one side is a bit cooked or about ¼ cooked, flip the paratha. You will see some air pockets beginning to form on paratha.Spread some oil or ghee (clarified butter) on the side that is facing you. Flip again and you should see some brown or golden spots on the paratha. Spread ghee on this side having the golden spots.Flip again a couple of times, until the paratha is evenly roasted and has some golden spots or blisters. Press the paratha edges with a spatula so that they get cooked.Roll the remaining dough balls and make the methi parathas this way. While making the second paratha don’t forget to wipe the skillet with a kitchen napkin if there is any excess whole wheat flour on it.Serving SuggestionsMethi paratha is best served hot. However, it can be served warm or at room temperature. You can also stack them in a roti basket or casserole box/container.Easily enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or at dinner. My favorite things to serve with methi ke parathe are vegetable curries, sweetened curd, or pickle.Some people like to have parathas with plain curd (yogurt), mango pickle, lemon pickle, or green chili pickle. It all depends on your preference!They can also be wrapped in foil and packed in lunch boxes or for short journeys.

You can also sliver or slice the nuts.Grate 250 to 300 grams paneer. You can also crumble the paneer. If the paneer is refrigerated, then I suggest to grate it. If freshly made, then you can crumble it finely. There should be no chunks in the crumble.Making kalakand sweetTake 1 tin/can (400 grams) of sweetened condensed milk in a thick bottomed pan or kadai.Add the grated or crumbled paneer to the condensed milk. Mix very well.I did add some sugar as I felt the sweet taste was less for us. I added 1 tablespoons sugar. You can check the taste and add accordingly.Keep the heat on low or sim and cook this mixture of condensed milk and grated paneer.Stir the mixture often so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.The kalakand mixture will start thickening as it simmers and begins to cook.When the mixture gets thickened well, looks like one mass and starts leaving the sides of the pan then switch off the heat.Keep in mind that the kalakand mixture should have some moisture and should not look dry. It should not have a liquid consistency or be runny. It took me 15 minutes on a low heat. Depending on the quality of your pan, pan thickness and size, flame intensity it may take 12 to 16 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add cardamom powder and rose water.

Drain the water. Then remove the peels from the nuts.Slice or sliver or chop them and set aside.Cooking milk to half of its volumeTake whole milk in a thick bottomed kadai or pan and begun to heat the milk on a low to medium heat, till the milk starts to froth or form a layer of clotted cream (malai) on top. Stir a couple of time when the milk is getting heated.So when you will see the cream floating on top, then with a spatula, gently move the cream layer.Bring it towards the side of the pan and stick it to the pan. Keep the heat to a low and continue to simmer. Keep on simmering the milk like this and collecting the cream layer on the sides.This process of collecting the cream layer has to be done many times. continuous simmering of the milk will bring the cream on top and you have to bring and stick it to the sides of the pan.In between also stir the milk gently on occasions, so that the milk does not get burnt from the bottom. If you do too much of stirring and if quickly, then you won't get the layers of cream in the rabri. So after you have moved the layer of cream (malai) to the side of the pan, then stir the milk a few times. Then wait until another layer of cream forms on the surface of the milk. You can also just thicken and scrape the milk solids from the sides but in this case you won't get the layers of clotted cream or malai in the rabdi. Making rabdi recipeOnce the milk reduces to half, then add sugar. You can add sugar as per your taste preferences.Then add crushed saffron strands and cardamom powder. Stir gently.Continue collecting the cream and bringing it to the sides of the pan. Also do stir the milk gently after you bring the cream towards the sides of the pan. If you don't stir the milk then there is a possibility of the milk getting browned or burnt from the bottom.After adding saffron, the color will change gradually to a beautiful yellow color as the milk keeps on reducing.When the milk gets reduced to ⅓ or ¼ of its original quantity, then switch off the heat. It took me about 1 hour 15 minutes on a low heat initially and medium heat towards the latter stage. I cooked it until ⅓ of its original volume. The cream layer will be collected on the sides with a spatula. Scrape off the entire cream layer as well as dried milk solids and add into the thickened milk.Stir gently. Then add the sliced almonds, pistachios and 1 teaspoon rose water or kewra water. Stir gently again. Reserve a few of the blanched and slivered nuts for garnishServing and Storage SuggestionsGarnish with some of the blanched almond and pistachio slivers. Serve rabdi hot or warm.If you are not serving hot or warm, let rabri cool at room temperature first. Transfer the cooled rabdi in an air-tight steel container and refrigerate it for a few hours.Keep in mind that it will thicken more as it cools at room temperature and even in the refrigerator. So keep the consistency slightly thin if you want to refrigerate it and serve cold or chilled.Whether you serve hot or warm or cold, if you prefer, garnish rabdi with some of the blanched, slivered nuts and sprinkle a bit of crushed saffron from top.Rabdi keeps well in the refrigerator for about 3 to 4 days.

Soak both the kidney beans (rajma) and whole black lentils (urad dal) in enough water, overnight if you are making this in the morning. If you are making it in the evening, then soak the lentils in the morning.Later discard all the water from the lentils well and then rinse them with fresh water. Drain the water again.Add the rinsed lentils in the inner cooking pot of the IP. Making tomato pureeTake the chopped tomatoes, chopped ginger and chopped garlic in a blender or mixer jar. Alternatively, you can use 1 cup canned tomato purée and 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste and add directly in the pot. Blend till fine and smooth. Set aside.Cooking in the instant potAdd all the spices powders – turmeric powder, cumin powder, kashmiri chilli powder and Garam Masala or Punjabi Garam masala. Also, add salt as per taste.Now add the blended tomato, ginger, garlic puree and 3 cups water. You can even add finely chopped ⅓ to ½ cup onions at this step. Stir and mix very well.Turn on the Instant Pot. Press the pressure cooker button on high pressure and set the timer to 30 minutes. You can even use the Bean/Chili option of the Instant Pot which has an auto setting of pressure cooking on high pressure for 30 minutes.When the cooking time is completed and you hear the beep sound, wait for 10 or 12 minutes. Then do a quick pressure release (QPR) – carefully lift the pressure valve to remove the extra steam and pressure.Remove the lid. You will see that that the beans and lentils are cooked well, but the consistency of the curry is slightly watery and broth-like. Note that the final consistency should be smooth and creamy. Thus the whole mixture has to be simmered until the consistency thickens a bit and becomes creamy. Keep in mind that the lentils have to be softened and cooked well. You should be able to mash both the urad dal and rajma with a spoon if they are cooked completely. If the lentils are undercooked than pressure cook for some more minutes. Add some water if required. Simmering furtherOnce the lentils have softened and tender, they need to be simmered further. To do this, press the sauté button on Instant Pot and set the time to 7 or 8 minutes on normal setting.Add the butter. Stir and mix to combine.With the back of the spoon mash some of the lentils and beans. Stir often. The stirring will also help in mashing a few of the cooked lentils and beans. Mashing the lentils also helps in making the gravy smooth as well as slightly thickens the consistency.While using the sauté option, you can even set it to the low mode for a slow simmer. But keep on stirring often. Once the consistency is thickened, add cream and kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Mix well. Both these ingredients are optional and you can skip them. Remember the consistency should be neither thick nor thin. If it becomes too thick and then add some water. Also, keep in mind that the consistency will thicken more on cooling.While simmering do stir often so that the lentils do not stick to the bottom of the inner pot. Serve Instant Pot Dal Makhani with Indian Flatbreads like roti, naan bread, tandoori roti or lachha paratha or aloo paratha. You can also serve it with cumin rice or biryani rice.

See that the leaves are clean and devoid of any muddy particles on them.Drain all the water and soak them in fresh water for a few more minutes. Drain the water. Repeat this process once or twice. Finally, drain all the water.Now chop the fenugreek leaves. You could do this with a knife or chop them in a food processor. While chopping in the food processor, make sure you do not chop it to fine or make a paste of it.Preparing potatoesRinse, peel and chop the potatoes into small cubes or squares.In a heavy skillet, kadai or pan, heat up the oil. Add the potatoes first.Saute the potatoes for some minutes on medium-low to medium heat until they start looking crisp and are lightly browned from the edges.Add the chopped green chilies and asafoetida. Stir. If you don't have green chilies, add about ¼ to ½ teaspoon of red chili powder or cayenne pepper.Making aloo methiNow add the chopped methi (fenugreek leaves). Mix very well.Add salt. Give a good stir, and let the aloo methi continue to cook for a couple of minutes uncovered on medium-low to medium heat. When the methi begins to produce water, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 to 6 more minutes on a low to medium-low heat. The liquid should be totally evaporated in the dish and the fenugreek leaves will become completely wilted.Sauté for a couple more minutes to get the potatoes and methi nice and dry.If your potatoes are not quite cooked when the liquid has dried up, add a tablespoon or so of water and continue to cook.Later, if you see any extra water in the pan, then simmer until all the water is dried up.Once cooked, you can either mix in a bit of butter for extra rich flavor or serve plain as-is. Serving suggestionsServe aloo methi with Indian breads like paratha, roti, naan.  You could even make this dish as a side vegetable with your Indian main course.StorageUsually there won't be any leftovers. If there are leftovers then place in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Reheat by simply warming up in a small pan or skillet sprinkling few drops of water.

This roti or chapati recipe of an unleavened flatbread is made with basic ingredients – whole wheat flour, ghee, salt and water.",10minutes,30minutes,1hour,15,roti,Main Course,Indian,"Vegan, Vegetarian",▢ 3 cups whole wheat flour or atta – 360 grams▢ 1 to 1.25 cups water or add more if needed▢ 1 teaspoon salt – optional▢ 1 to 2 tablespoons oil  or ghee (clarified butter) – optional,"Kneading Roti DoughTake whole wheat flour (atta) in a bowl. Sift the flour with salt if you have flour which has a lot of bran. Add a bit of water, oil or ghee and start mixing.Adding water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough.Continue to knead the dough. Keep on adding water as required.Knead the dough till it becomes pliable, smooth and soft. The final dough consistency should not be very sticky or loose or hard.Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands to smoothen it.Flatten the ball. Sprinkle some whole wheat flour to the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour.Making PhulkaTurn on the gas stove and put the tawa to make it hot.While tawa is getting hot, start rolling the dough ball into a flat round circle.Once the tawa is sufficiently hot then put the roti on a hot tawa/griddle.First cook one side. It should be less than half cooked or about one-fourth cooked.Turn and cook the other side. This should be a little bit more cooked than the first side. Brown spots should be visible.Now hold the roti with a tong and keep the first side which was cooked, directly on fire. The roti will start to puff.Turn and keep the other side on fire. The roti will puff more. Avoid burning the rotis and also don’t overdo it as roti will not be soft and will become crisp and hard like papadums.Remove and apply ghee or oil on the phulka. Applying ghee or oil keep them soft for a long time. Phulka made with this method is ideally served hot.If you cannot serve them hot, then you can keep them in a container that keeps food warm like a casserole or in a roti basket. You can also wrap them up in a kitchen towel or napkin.Making Roti on TawaPlace the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Keep the heat to medium-high or high. Within some seconds you will see air pockets forming on the raw chapati doughRoast for about 30 seconds or so and you will see the air-pockets increase on the surface.Keep in mind that the timing will change or vary with the kind of skillet you are using, the chapati thickness and the intensity of the flame.Flip with spatula or tongs and roast the second side for about a minute. Flip again and you will see the second side cooked more than the first side with visible brown spots. With a clean folded cotton kitchen napkin or a spatula, begin to press the partially cooked roti on all sides and center. Pressing it evenly all over helps to puff up the roti. Keep on pressing all over, especially the flat portions, so that the entire roti gets puffed up well.If you prefer you can flip again and cook the second side too for some seconds if its looks under cooked. Transfer the soft and puffed roti in a roti-basket and spread some oil or ghee on top.Making ChapatiKeep the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook on medium-high to high heat for about 30 seconds or so until you see some air pockets all over. Flip the chapati and spread some oil all over while the second side is getting roasted. Cook the second side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.Flip again with a spatula. You will see that the second side is well roasted with some blisters and brown spots.Spread some oil on this cooked side. Roast the first side again for about 20 to 30 seconds.Remove and transfer to a chapati container or box. Keep covered. Make chapati with the rest of the dough in this manner.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe roti or phulka or chapati with any Indian meal. Accompany it with vegetable or paneer curries, stir-fried or sautéed vegetables (sabji) or lentils (dals). Store any leftover dough in an air-tight container for just about 1 to 2 days. If the dough has darkened or has a weird smell, then throw it away. Store the flatbreads in a roti box or in a covered container for a few hours. Always cover with a tight lid, so that the flatbreads remain soft. Brushing or spreading with some oil or ghee on the roti, keeps them softer.

First add ½ cup water and with a wired whisk begin to mix. If the batter looks thick, then add 1 to 3 tablespoons more water. Depending on the quality and texture of besan, you can add less or more water. Mix to a smooth flowing consistency in the batter. Break lumps if any while mixing batter.Cooking besan chillaHeat a frying pan or a skillet on a low to medium-low heat. You can use an iron skillet or a non-stick pan. If using iron skillet or tawa, then spread a bit of oil on it.Let the pan become medium hot. Then take a ladle full of the batter and pour on the panGently with the back of the ladle, begin to spread the batter.Spread lightly and gently so that the cheela does not break.On a low flame cook the chilla till the top begins to look cooked.Then drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon oil on the chilla at the edges and all around.Continue to cook till the base gets light golden.Flip and now cook the other side.Cook this side until you see golden spots on the besan chilla.Fold and serve chilla hot or warm. Besan chilla are best had hot. But if you are not able to serve them hot, then place them in a roti basket or casserole. They remain warm and can be served later.Serving suggestionsEnjoy besan chilla as it is or with a side dip of coriander chutney or mint chutney or any chutney of your choice or with tomato ketchup. You can serve it with plain curd (yogurt) or raita.We also like to have it with roti or bread. I sometimes make simple sandwiches stuffing the chilla between two bread slices spread with some coriander chutney and butter. You can make the besan chilla sandwich with toasted bread if you like. Storage Besan Chilla are best served hot and crisp as soon as they are made. They taste good when they become warm too. If I plan to serve them later in the day, I stack them in a steel box or a roti box which keeps them warm and moist. Make these as needed. I do not suggest to make a large batch for storage. On refrigeration the chilla becomes dry and lightly dense. Reheating them does not bring up the original flavors and they taste kind of dull.

Take the hot ghee or oil and all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, all the spices, dry fenugreek leaves, salt and baking soda in a mixing bowl.First mix everything well with a spoon. Then when the mixture is warm or cool enough to handle, mix the fat evenly in the flour with your fingertips.The whole mixture should resemble breadcrumbs. The more you do this, the more flaky texture the mathri or mathiya will have.Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water at a time and only mix the dough. Don't knead like a roti or poori dough. But only mix the water in the dough until it comes together. When the whole mixture can be easily clumped or gathered together into a ball, cover with a kitchen towel and keep aside to rest for 30 mins.Rolling mathariHeat oil for frying in a kadai (wok) or frying pan. Pinch small balls from the dough. Simply roll them lightly in your palms to even them. No need to give them a proper round shape.Keep the balls covered with a kitchen towel so that they do not dry out.Flatten each ball with a rolling pin to medium thickness. You will see jagged uneven edges and they are alright. Prick each rolled dough with a fork or pierce them with a knife.In case you want a smooth finish, then use a biscuit or cookie cutter. Roll a large piece of dough and cut with a cookie cutter.Frying MathriCheck the hotness of oil before frying the mathari.Drop a small piece and if comes to the surface gradually, then the oil is ready.If it comes to quickly, then the oil is very hot and the mathri will brown from out but remain uncooked from inside and will become soft.If it comes slowly, then the oil is cold. Result would be the mathari would absorb a lot of oil and become dense due to over frying.Fry them in medium hot oil turning over as needed until crisp and golden.Regulate the heat between medium-low to medium if required.Drain on kitchen paper towels and when cooled store them in an airtight box.Fry them in batches this way. Serve these flaky spiced punjabi mathri with ginger tea or masala tea as an evening snack.Baking MathriPreheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit).Roll the dough into round disc as mentioned above.Place them in a baking pan or tray and then bake for 20 to 30 mins or till light golden in the preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit).After 10 to 12 minutes, turn over the mathri for even baking and browning.If even after 20 to 30 minutes the mathri look soft or under-baked, then bake for some more minutes.Please keep an eye on the baking as oven temperatures differ in various models and brands.Remove with a spatula and place the baked crackers on a wire rack to cool.Once cooled, store them in an airtight container or jar.",NutritionCalories: 53kcal | Carbohydrates: 8g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 2g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 4mg | Sodium: 48mg | Potassium: 21mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 3IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 4mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 16µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 5mg | Phosphorus: 17mg | Zinc: 1mg

After fermentation the batter will have tiny air-pockets in it with a tangy taste. Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.With a spoon mix very well.Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.Preparing sugar syrupTake 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebi.Add ½ cup of water.Keep this pan on stove top on low heat and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the heat and add ¼ tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebi in it.Frying jalebiHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavor.To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebi to be fried. The frying temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit/176 degrees Celsius.Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.You won't get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.Some jalebi will be cooked faster than others.Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.Adding fried jalebi to sugar syrupThen immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes or more, they will have a deep color.Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature. The leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated.",NutritionCalories: 85kcal | Carbohydrates: 15g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 2g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Sodium: 15mg | Potassium: 17mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 10g | Vitamin A: 1IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 3mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 15µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 3mg | Phosphorus: 10mg | Zinc: 1mg

This recipe post shows the method of making both aam panna syrup concentrate and the drink using the method of boiling as well as roasting mangoes.",15minutes,5minutes,20minutes,12,Aam Panna Drink,Beverages,Indian,Vegan,"For boiled aam panna – Recipe 1▢ 2  mangoes – 400 grams, medium-sized unripe green mangoes ▢ 2 cups water – for pressure cooking▢ 1.5 cups sugar or jaggery powder – 325 grams sugar or add as required▢ 1 teaspoon cardamom powder▢ 1 teaspoon  Roasted Cumin Powder▢ ¼  teaspoon black pepper powder or crushed black pepper – optional▢ 2 teaspoons black salt – add regular white salt, pink salt or edible rock salt instead","Making Boiled Aam Panna – Recipe 1Rinse the raw mangoes in water a couple of times. Place the mangoes in a 2-litre pressure cooker. Add 2 cups water.Pressure cook for 2 whistles on medium flame or for about 8 to 10 minutes.When pressure settles down on its own, then remove the lid. The mangoes would have become soft. The peels would have also separated  if the mangoes are cooked well.Gently pour the contents of the cooker in a fine strainer. Place a bowl underneath. Do not discard the water. Use this water to make aam panna drink.Let the mangoes cool at room temperature. Place them in a bowl. After cooking the raw mangoes, the peel comes off easily.Making syrup – Recipe 1With a sharp-edged spoon or a knife scrape and remove the cooked mango pulp directly in the bowl. Scrape from the peels also.Collect the cooked mango pulp in a bowl. Discard the peels.As a rule always add double the amount of jaggery or sugar to the mango pulp. The ratio is 1:2 for mango pulp and jaggery respectively. So before adding sugar or jaggery measure the amount of mango pulp in a measuring cup. If you get 1 cup of mango pulp, then add 2 cups of sugar. I got about ¾ cup of mango pulp and so added 1.5 cups sugar.Now add the required amount of sugar or jaggery.Add cardamom powder, roasted cumin powder, black salt, crushed black pepper or pepper powder. Mix very well. You could also use a blender or hand churner to blend the aam panna syrup.Pour the aam panna syrup in a clean glass bottle or jar. Store the bottle or jar in the fridge.Making panna drink – Recipe 1For making aam panna drink, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of aam panna syrup in a glass.Add the water in which the mangoes were cooked or chilled water. You can also add water at room temperature. Stir and mix well. Serve aam panna. You can also add some ice cubes while serving. You can even garnish with some mint leaves or coriander leaves or lemon wedges. Making Roasted Aam Panna – Recipe 2Rinse and then wipe dry the mangoes. Keep a roti rack or papad rack on a gas stove top. Place the mangoes on it.Keep on turning them at intervals so that they are charred and cooked evenly.The peels should get charred. To check doneness, slid a knife on one of the sides and the knife should slid easily without any resistance.Keep the roasted mangoes aside and let them cool at room temperature. You can also keep them in water for some minutes and then peel them. Once they cool down, then remove the charred peels. Remove the peels well. Slice the mangoes.Add the sliced mango pulp to a blender or mixer jar. Then add mint leaves, roasted cumin powder, black salt and sugar.For aam panna, the sugar is added twice of the mango pulp. I had got slightly more than ½ cup of mango pulp. Thus I added 1 cup sugar. Depending on the type and quality of mangoes the amount of pulp will vary. So do measure the pulp before you add sugar. So if you get lets say, 1 cup mango pulp, then add 2 cups sugar. Without adding any water, blend till smooth.The aam panna syrup should have a smooth consistency. If there are fibers in the pulp, then do strain it. Remove in a clean small jar or bowl. Cover and refrigerate.Preparing Roasted Aam Panna Drink – Recipe 2Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the aam panna syrup in a glass. Then add water and mix very well. Add ice cubes if you like.Serve aam panna immediately. You can garnish with mint leaves if you want.",NutritionCalories: 118kcal | Carbohydrates: 30g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 390mg | Potassium: 64mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 30g | Vitamin A: 376IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 13mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 2µg | Calcium: 8mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 15µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 5mg | Phosphorus: 6mg | Zinc: 1mg

Drain all the water. Then wipe them dry with a kitchen towel. You can even keep them spread on a plate and let them dry naturally. The bhindi should be completely dry before you proceed with the second step.Slice of the crown part of each bhindi. This part is discarded. Then slice off the base tip. This part is also discarded.Next, with a knife give a slit on the bhindi without breaking it into two parts. The entire bhindi (okra) should be intact. With clean thumbs and fingers gently open the sliced part and check to see if there are any worms. If there are worms or black spots, then discard the bhindi.Repeat the above slicing steps with all of the bhindi. Making Stuffing MasalaCombine all the ground spices and salts listed under ""Ground Spices Stuffing"" section above except asafoetida in a bowl. Mix very well.Stuff the spice mix in each bhindi with a small spoon or with your fingers.Repeat with the entire lot of bhindi.Making bharwa bhindiTake a heavy pan or kadai (wok) large enough that can accommodate the okra in one single layer.Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in it. Keep heat to a low or medium-low and add 1 pinch asafoetida (hing). Stir and mix with oil. If you do not have asafoetida, then skip it.Then immediately add the stuffed bhindi in the oil and gently stir to combine with the oil.If any masala remains you can add it to the bhindi in the kadai. Also, add the masala which must have fallen on the chopping board while stuffing bhindi.Gently mix and stir again. Cook the stuffed bhindi on a low to medium-low heat.Do not cover the kadai with any lid as this can make the okra slimy. Let the bhindi cook on a low to medium-low heat. We don't want the masala to burn hence the bhindi needs to be cooked on a low to medium-low heat. Also do not add any water.The bhindi should not be on top of each other. Hence arrange them separately in a single layer on the kadai/pan, so that each bhindi is evenly cooked.Ensure that you check the bhindi in between and also give a gently stir after every 3 to 4 minutes. After giving a stir make sure each stuffed bhindi is arranged separately in a single layer. This helps in even cooking.Slow cook until the bhindi is tender and well cooked. At this point, check taste of bhindi and if the salt is less then sprinkle some salt from above and stir to combine.Final TouchesTake the kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) in your palms. Crush kasuri methi between your palms, and sprinkle on the bhindi.If you do not have kasuri methi, then skip adding.Also add garam masala powder.

Check the taste and add more salt if required. Now add paneer, which has been chopped in cubes.Gently mix and let the marination coat the paneer cubes evenly. Cover and keep aside for 30 minutes. If keeping for more than 30 minutes, then refrigerate.Making green chutneyTake all the ingredients for the green chutney in a grinder jar. Add 1 teaspoon water (optional) and grind coarsely. Since the coriander and mint leaves are rinsed, the moisture from them helps in grinding.Then add 2 tablespoon hung yogurt or thick curd.Grind to a smooth chutney. Remove in a bowl and keep aside. You can even refrigerate the chutney.Making veggie saladThinly slice onion, grate carrots and shred the cabbage or thinly slice them. Also thinly slice capsicum (bell pepper).Take all the veggies in a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon chaat masala, 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Also add salt as per taste.Mix very well and keep aside.Kneading doughIn a mixing bowl or pan or a large tray, take whole wheat flour, ½ tablespoon oil and salt.Then add ½ cup water in parts. First you can add ¼ cup water and add the remaining required amount of water later.Begin to knead. Add water as required and knead to a smooth soft dough.Cover the dough and keep aside for it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.Making rotiAfter 20 to 30 minutes, divide the dough into small or medium sized balls. This depends on the size of the wraps you want to make. You can also make mini wraps.Dust the dough ball with some flour. Then gently roll to thin roti. The roti should not be thick. If required while rolling, you can add some more flour.Place the roti on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook the base till you see blisters appearing on the roti or the roti is ¼ᵗʰ  cooked. Do note that the tawa or skillet should be hot. So cook on a medium-high to high flame. On a low flame, the roti will become very crispy or hard.Then flip roti. spread some oil all over.Then flip again when the second side is ½ cooked.Spread some oil on this side too. You will see golden blisters on the roti.Flip once or twice more for even roasting. Remove and keep the roti in a roti basket or in a warm casserole. Prepare all rotis this way.Making paneer tikkaHeat 2 tablespoons oil in a pan. Keep the flame to low or medium-low and add the marinated paneer cubes. Add the entire marination. Since I had used hung yogurt, I added the entire marinated mixture as the hung yogurt marination had coated the paneer pieces very well. But if you have used yogurt which has a thin consistency, then just add the paneer cubes.After a minute turn over the paneer cubes.Pan fry the paneer cubes turning often till the marination is cooked and the paneer becomes soft.Keep on stirring and turning them at intervals. Also use a well seasoned pan or a non stick pan, so that the paneer cubes do not stick to the pan while frying.I cooked the paneer for about 4 minutes on a medium-low heat. Do not cook too much as then paneer will become dense, cook on medium-low flame. Timing will vary with the thickness of the pan, intensity of the flame etc.Once the paneer is done, remove the pan from the flame and keep aside.Assembling & making paneer kathi rollTake one roti.Spread the mint-coriander-curd chutney over it.Now place the paneer tikka cubes in the center.Top with the veg salad.Roll both the sides of the roti and make a wrap.Wrap half portion of the rolls in butter paper or aluminium foil. If packing paneer roll for tiffin, then wrap the entire roll in aluminium foil and skip adding the green chutney and veggie salad.Serve paneer kathi roll with the remaining chutney or tomato ketchup. You can also add some of the veg salad as a garnish on the paneer wrap.",NutritionCalories: 406kcal | Carbohydrates: 31g | Protein: 14g | Fat: 26g | Saturated Fat: 9g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 10g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 34mg | Sodium: 520mg | Potassium: 306mg | Fiber: 6g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 2404IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 19mg | Vitamin E: 6mg | Vitamin K: 15µg | Calcium: 310mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 32µg | Iron: 2mg | Magnesium: 58mg | Phosphorus: 161mg | Zinc: 1mg

If there are any insects or mold or fungi, then discard the spices. Don’t use them.Add the whole spices in a plate or tray. Keep the plate in the sun for 2 to 3 days.Instead of sun-drying, you can lightly roast/toast in a frying pan, all the whole spices until except for dry ginger powder (ground ginger) and rose petals.While being sun dried, cover with a wire-meshed lid or a muslin or loosely woven cotton napkin, so that dust does not fall on the spices, when they are being sun dried. During the day, I would keep the spices out. During night, I would keep the plate inside with a loose lid covering it.After getting sun dried, there is no trace of moisture in the spices and they also become slightly crisp.Make Garam MasalaBefore you begin, grinding the whole spices, take the nutmeg in a mortar-pestle and crush it coarsely. Keep aside.Now add all the whole spices in the dry grinder jar. Break the cinnamon, tej patta and then add. You can also use a coffee grinder. Add according to the capacity of the jar.Then add the coarsely crushed nutmeg powder.Next add 2 tablespoons ginger powder. If you plan to roast/toast the spices for making garam masala, then do not roast ginger powder. Grind to a smooth powder. You can grind in 1 or 2 batches.If using dried rose petals, then add them at this step. If you don’t have rose petals then skip adding them. Again grind.If you want, you can sift it and grind the tiny bits left on the sieve.Let the powder cool down. You can spread it in a plate or allow it to cool in the grinder jar itself.StorageSpoon the powder in a clean glass jar.Cover tightly and keep in a cool dry place. You can also keep it in the refrigerator or freezer.This recipe yields about 190 grams of garam masala.",NutritionCalories: 18kcal | Carbohydrates: 3g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 4mg | Potassium: 67mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 23IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 39mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 14mg | Phosphorus: 16mg | Zinc: 1mg

Methi pulao will pair nicely with most raita varieties like onion raita, cucumber raita, boondi raita or onion tomato raita. With Dal: Even with a simple dal fry or dal tadka, methi pulao tastes delicious.In a lunch box: Methi rice also stays good in the lunch box for some hours. When packing it in a lunch box, add a side of veggie salad or a mango or lemon pickle. You can also pack it for short travels.StoringI do not recommend to freeze or make a large batch for freezing. Cooked rice is better had fresh on the same day. If you have any leftovers than store in the fridge for a day only and not more than a day.

Try my authentic Punjabi recipe of this scrumptious Shakkarpare snack that you can literally munch on, any time!",5minutes,45minutes,50minutes,450,grams,"Snacks, Sweets",North Indian,Vegetarian,For the dough▢ 240 grams whole wheat flour  (atta) or 2 cups whole wheat flour▢ 2 tablespoons Ghee▢ ½ cup water or add as required,"Making Shakarpara DoughTake whole wheat flour in a mixing bowl or pan. Add 2 tablespoons of ghee. The ghee should be at room temperature and in a semi solid state. Instead of whole wheat flour you can also take all purpose flour and oil instead of ghee.With your fingertips, mix the ghee with the flour very well.When you press the flour and ghee mixture in your palm, you should get a flour lump like shown in the picture below. The mixture should be able to hold itself together without falling apart.Now add water in parts. Depending on the quality of flour, you can add less or more water. I added ½ cup water.Begin to knead the dough. Add water as required. If you use all-purpose flour, you will need less water.Knead to a firm semi soft dough. Neither too soft nor too hard. The dough should be not soft like the dough we make for chapatis.Divide the dough into three equal parts. Cover with a lid.Take one part and roll into a thick paratha of 7 to 8 inches in diameter.With a knife make squares or diamond shapes on the rolled dough, by slicing criss cross or vertically-horizontally.Frying ShakkarpareHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Test the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough in the pan. This small piece of the dough should come up gradually and quickly on the surface. If it comes slowly, the oil has a lower temperature and if it comes up too quickly, the oil has high temperature. I fried on medium heat. You can regulate the heat while frying by increasing or decreasing it.Slid the cut diamond shaped dough in the medium hot oil.Depending on the pan size, you can add more or less. But do make sure that there is some space while frying them.When the shakkarpara are crisp and light golden, turn over and fry.Keep on frying them and turning as and when needed for even frying.Fry till all of them turn golden.Remove with a slotted spoon and drain shakkar pare on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.Continue to prepare the shakkarpara and fry them as mentioned in the above steps.When you are begin frying the last batch, you can start preparing the sugar syrup. Let all the shakkarpara come to room temperature, before you add them in the sugar syrup.Making sugar syrupTake 1 cup sugar in another kadai or pan. Add ½ cup water.Keep the pan on a low to medium heat. Stir so that the sugar dissolves.Continue cooking the sugar syrup till it starts bubbling and getting sticky. A suggestion here is to add some saffron strands in sugar syrup to get orange or yellow colored shakkarpara.Simmer till you get a 2 to 3 thread consistency in the syrup. To check the consistency, take a bit of the syrup in a spoon. Let it become warm and then take the syrup between your forefinger and thumb. Press and separate the fingers. You should see two to three threads in the sugar syrup.Once the two to three thread consistency is reached, quickly add all the shakkarpara in the syrup.Briskly stir and toss well, so that all the shakkarpara are coated with the sugar syrup.The sugar syrup crystallizes soon, so mix very well and be quick.Now take all the shakkarpara in a plate and allow them to come at room temperature. The sugar syrup will crystallize on cooling.Once all of them cool down, store shakkarpara in an air-tight box or jar. These stay good for a few months.",NutritionServing: 1small bowl | Calories: 276kcal | Carbohydrates: 47g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 9g | Saturated Fat: 3g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 8mg | Sodium: 3mg | Potassium: 116mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 25g | Vitamin A: 2IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 13mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 13µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 41mg | Phosphorus: 107mg | Zinc: 1mg

Don't add too much water as then the fritters become too crispy and soak a lot of oil.Take the ground batter in a bowl and add salt.Stir the batter briskly for a couple of minutes. This brisk stirring makes the batter more light and fluffy.The test to a correct consistency of this batter is the floating test. Take some water in a small bowl. Add 1 tsp of a batter in the water. The batter should float. If it does not float, this means the consistency is thin. Add some sooji or rice flour to the batter to thicken it.Frying bhalla and soaking in waterHeat a kadai or pan with oil for deep frying.When the oil becomes medium hot, add a small amount of batter in the oil. It should come steadily and quickly on the surface. This means it is the right temperature to fry.

Add according to the capacity of the pan or kadai.When they become pale golden, then turn them.Fry the fritters till they become golden and crispy. Turn them a couple of times for even frying.Fry till golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon.Drain on paper towels.

Then rub and mix the ghee with the flours, with your fingertips to form a bread crumb like texture.Add water in parts and begin to knead. The amount of water needed will depend on the quality and texture of the flour.Knead the dough till firm and tight. Cover the dough with a moist cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.Making sweet stuffingCrumble or grate the khoya (mawa).Chop the nuts, raisins and set aside.Melt ghee in a pan on a low heat.Add the crumbled or grated khoya.Stir the khoya continuously on a low heat.Cook the khoya, till it begins to gather around itself. Switch off the heat and place the pan on the kitchen countertop. Let the khoya stuffing cool completely at room temperature. Later add powdered sugar, the chopped nuts, raisins and cardamom powder. Better to sieve the powdered sugar if there are lumps.Mix everything well and keep the stuffing aside. Check the taste and add more sugar if you prefer.Assembling and shapingDivide the dough into two parts.Make a medium log of each part and slice it into equal parts.Roll each part in your palms to make balls and place all the balls in the same bowl. Cover with a moist kitchen towel.Dust the rolling board lightly with some flour. Roll each ball with the rolling pin to a small circle having 4 to 5 inches diameter. Don't add too much flour while rolling. If you can roll without the flour, then it is better.With your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply water all over the circumference edge.Place about 1 to 1.5 tablespoon of the prepared khoya filling on one side of the circle, keeping the edges empty. Don’t add too much of stuffing as it becomes difficult to shape gujiya and they may break in the oil.Carefully, bring together both the edges and join. Gently press the edges.With a small gujiya cutter or pizza cutter, trim the extra edges. When doing this method, it is very important that the gujiya is pressed and sealed well. Avoid this method if you plan to fry the gujiya. If baking then this method is good. As even if the filling comes out, you don't have to worry as there is no mess.However, it is best to make pleated design at the edges if you plan to fry the gujiya. This way the stuffing does not come out while frying and the gujiya look good too. Just keep on folding and twisting the edges till the end.Prepare gujiya this way and arrange them on a plate or tray. Cover the guijya with a moist napkin so that the dough does not dry out.Baking gujiyaPreheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius (390 degree fahrenheit). Brush oil or melted ghee n the gujiya evenly all over.Place them in a baking tray.Bake the mawa gujiya for 20 to 30 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (390 degree Fahrenheit), until they are golden. Oven temperatures vary, so do keep a check while baking. Place them on a wire rack for cooling. Once cooled, store them in an air-tight jar or box.Frying gujiyaHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.First test the temperature of oil, before frying. Add a small piece of the dough in the oil. If the dough comes up gradually and briskly, then the oil is ready. If the dough sits at the bottom, the oil is still cold. If the piece of dough comes up briskly and quickly, the oil is too hot.Gently slid the gujiya in oil. Just add a few pieces and don't overcrowd. At a time depending on the size of the pan/wok/kadai, you can fry 2 to 3 gujiya at a time on medium-heat. Turn them over carefully as fry the other side. Deep fry till they have become golden turning over as needed. Drain on kitchen paper tissues. Fry all gujiya this way and once they are cooled completely at room temperature, store them in an air-tight box.Serve gujiya to your family and guests when required.Serving suggestionsGujiya is eaten like any Indian sweet as it is. If you fancy something more indulgent, pair the mawa gujiya with some Rabri (thickened sweetened milk).StorageWhen the gujia cools at room temperature, immediately place them in an air-tight jar. They stay good for a few hours at room temperature. Since the stuffing is made with milk solids, I suggest to keep any leftovers in the refrigerator for about 1 to 2 days.",NutritionCalories: 221kcal | Carbohydrates: 24g | Protein: 6g | Fat: 12g | Saturated Fat: 5g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 10mg | Sodium: 95mg | Potassium: 76mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 81IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 123mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 25µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 23mg | Phosphorus: 63mg | Zinc: 1mg

189,Dry Jamun | Dry Gulab Jamun,"Dry Jamun as the name refers to is a dry variant of the popular juicy, moist and sugar syrup dunked, traditionally madeGulab Jamun. These delicious dry gulab jamuns are made with Khoya (evaporated milk solids), Paneer (Indian cottage cheese), milk and with a few flavoring ingredients.",15minutes,30minutes,45minutes,36,Dry Jamun,"Desserts, Sweets",North Indian,Vegetarian,"For the jamun balls▢ 250 grams Khoya – soft or 1 cup tightly packed khoya (mawa or dried evaporated milk solids)▢ 100 grams Paneer or ½ cup tightly packed grated paneer (cottage cheese)▢ 3 tablespoon all-purpose flour▢ 1 tablespoon milk▢ oil or ghee for deep frying, as required","Making dry jamun doughIn a mixing bowl, take the khoya or mawa. The khoya used for jamuns is the soft khoya also known as daap ka khoya or chikna khoya. This is a soft khoya, so it mashes and kneads very well.Mash the khoya very well with your hands. Keep aside. There should be no lumps or small bits or pieces in the khoya. You can also grate and then mash the khoya. Also, the mashed khoya should not feel granular.Grate the paneer and keep aside. 100 grams paneer yields about ½ cup grated paneer. Use a fine grater to grate the paneer.Now add the grated paneer and all-purpose flour (maida) to the mashed khoya.Add milk. Gently mix everything very well.Bring together this mixture and form into a dough. Do not knead the dough. Just mix and gather to a dough. If the mixture looks dry and does not cling together to a dough, you can add 1 tablespoon more of the milkNow pinch small marble sized balls from the dough and roll them in a round shape between your palms. Roll lightly and not heavily.Roll all the jamuns this way and keep them covered with a cotton kitchen towel.Making sugar syrupTake the sugar in a pan and add water.Keep this pan on stove top on a low to medium heat and stir so that the sugar begins to dissolve.When all the sugar is dissolved, add lemon juice. The lemon juice does not allow the sugar syrup to crystallize.Cook the sugar syrup on a low to medium heat till you get ½ string consistency or the syrup becomes sticky.Switch off the heat and add green cardamom powder, crushed saffron strands and rose water.Frying dry jamunWhen the sugar syrup is cooking, you can begin frying the jamuns. As when you add the fried jamuns, the sugar syrup needs to be hot. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep pan on a low to medium heat.For testing, slid a tiny dough ball in the hot oil. The ball should come up slowly and not quickly. This is the temperature at which we will fry the jamuns.Keep the heat to a low and fry this tiny jamun ball.Fry this small jamun till it becomes golden. If this jamun ball breaks, then add a few teaspoons of flour to the dough and mix well again. Before you begin shaping the jamuns, you can do this test.Now gently slid the jamuns. The heat should be low. Do not crowd and add the jamuns as per the size of the pan.When you see light golden spots, turn over the jamuns gently. The jamuns fry very quickly, so do be attentive.Keep on turning them in the oil, like a gentle swirling with the slotted spoon, so that they brown evenly.When frying the jamuns have to feel light and not heavy.Fry till they turn golden from all sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to remove excess oil.Making Dry Gulab JamunWhilst they are hot, quickly add them to the sugar syrup. Fry all the jamuns in the same way and add them to the sugar syrup. Note that the sugar syrup has to be hot. To maintain the hot temperature, you can keep the sugar syrup bowl or pan on a hot water bath. Cover and allow the jamuns to soak in the sugar syrup for about 2 hours.After 2 hours, gently strain the jamuns from the sugar syrup.Then take each jamun and roll it in a small plate consisting of 2 to 3 tablespoons of fine or superfine granulated sugar or 2 to 3 tablespoons of desiccated coconut.Roll them well, so that the sugar or desiccated coconut coats evenly. Place dry jamuns in a bowl or container. Close with a lid and refrigerate.Serve dry jamuns as a dessert or sweet. You can garnish with some sliced or chopped pistachios or blanched sliced almonds while serving.",NutritionCalories: 83kcal | Carbohydrates: 11g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 4g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Trans Fat: 0.01g | Cholesterol: 3mg | Sodium: 20mg | Potassium: 5mg | Fiber: 0.03g | Sugar: 9g | Vitamin A: 32IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.01mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.004mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 0.04mg | Vitamin B6: 0.001mg | Vitamin B12: 0.002µg | Vitamin C: 0.1mg | Vitamin D: 0.005µg | Vitamin E: 0.5mg | Vitamin K: 0.1µg | Calcium: 63mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 0.1mg | Magnesium: 1mg | Phosphorus: 1mg | Zinc: 0.01mg

The sattu stuffing mixture should not be too dry or too wet. If the mixture is dry, then the dryness is felt when eating litti.Stuffing & shaping littiAfter 30 minutes, now make small or medium sized balls from the dough.Sprinkling some flour, roll each dough ball to a circle of about 5 to 6 inches.Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing in the center.Pleat and then join the edges. Press the joined part and lightly roll the stuffed dough balls in your palms, so as to get a round shape. Keep aside.Another method is to flatten the the dough ball with your palms and make a shallow cup.Now place the stuffing.Gently bring together the outer dough cover in the center, while pressing the stuffing. Join and then seal the edges. This is a bit tricky method. So please use the method which suits you.Keep the prepared littis under a cotton towel or napkin, so that the dough does not dry out.Prepare all stuffed littis this way and place them on a baking tray, which has been greased with some oil. Do grease baking tray well, otherwise the littis can stuck to the tray.Baking littiPlace the littis in a preheated oven at 200° C/390° F. Preheat the oven for 20 minutes at 200° C/390° F prior to baking.After 10 to 15 minutes of baking, remove the tray and flip each litti. Keep the tray back in the oven.Again after 10 to 15 minutes, remove the baking tray and flip each litti. Place the tray back in the oven. This has to be done once or twice more for even baking of littis.Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes or till the crust looks done with some light brown or golden brown spots on them. Timing will vary upon the size and litres of the oven. It took me about 40 minutes for these to bake.Brush the littis with some melted ghee all over.This particular step is optional and only to get charred spots on the litti. Secure the baked litti in a pair of tongs and place it on fire. Rotate for a few seconds till you see some charred spots on litti.Serve these Bihari style litti with baingan chokha, aloo chokha and tomato chokha accompanied with a small bowl of melted ghee.

It is a variation of the classic paneer tikka where the cottage cheese cubes are flavored with a marination of pickling spices.,1hour,30minutes,1hour,4,,"Snacks, Starters",North Indian,Vegetarian,For the pickle masala or achari masala▢ 2 teaspoon split yellow mustard (rai ka kuria) or 1.5 teaspoon whole mustard seeds▢ 2 teaspoon fennel seeds▢ ½ teaspoon nigella seeds (kalonji)▢ ¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi dana)▢ 2 to 3 dry red chilies – deseeded and broken into small pieces▢ as substitute for above you can also add 2 tablespoon of ready made dry achar masala or pickle mix,"Preparing the achari masala or pickle mixFirst take all the spices namely – mustard seeds (i used split mustard seeds), fenugreek seeds, fennel seeds, nigella seeds and dry red chilies in a dry grinder or coffee grinder or blender.Grind all these spices to a fine powder. A slight semi fine texture is also ok. This is the dry achari masala. Keep aside.Making MarinationIn a bowl take hung yogurt or thick yogurt and whisk till smooth. To make hung yogurt, place the yogurt in a muslin cloth or a cotton napkin. Tie tightly and place on a strainer, which is kept over a bowl. Keep in the fridge till all the whey gets collected in the bowl. This takes about 4 to 5 hours. You can also keep overnight. Here I used thick yogurt.Add the powdered achari masala, red chili powder, gram flour/corn starch, ginger-garlic paste, asafoetida, coriander powder, red chili powder, dry mango powder or lime juice, crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi), salt and mustard oil. You can also use ready made achar masala or pickle masala. Add about 2 tbsp of dry achar masala in the marinade.Mix everything into the beaten curd. Check the taste and add more salt or other seasoning if required.Add the bell peppers, onions and paneer cubes.Gently mix the paneer cubes and veggies till they are evenly coated with the achari marinade.Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour or overnight. You can also keep for any number of hours.Once you remove from the the marinated cottage cheese cubes and veggies from the fridge, then gently mix again.Grilling method for making achari paneer tikkaPreheat your oven to 200 degrees celsius/390 degrees fahrenheit for at least 10 minutes before you grill the tikkas. For a regular oven, keep both the top and bottom elements on and keep the pan in the center or top rack. For a microwave oven use the convection mode and preheat at 180 degrees celsius/350 degrees fahrenheit.Thread the veggies and paneer cubes on a bamboo skewer or metal skewer. You can alsoUse toothpicks.Cover a baking tray with an aluminium foil. Avoid butter paper like I have done as the paneer sticks to the butter paper once grilled.Brush the marinated paneer with ½ to 1 teaspoon of mustard oil or any other oil.Place the tray in a the top rack or middle rack of a preheated oven. Keep both the top and bottom heating elements on. Grill at 200 degrees celsius for 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the oven temperatures). I have a slow oven, so it took 25 mins for the paneer cubes to be grilled and browned at the edges. Just keep an eye when the paneer is getting grilled in the oven. For a microwave oven in the convection mode, use 180 degrees celsius/350 degrees fahrenheit for grilling the tikka.Pan frying or stove top methodHeat about 2 to 3 teaspoon oil in a non stick pan. You can add more oil if you want.Place the threaded paneer tikka with the skewers on the pan. You can also fry the marinated paneer cubes and veggies without the skewers.Gently rotate the skewers, when one side is crisp and browned. Keep on rotating till all the sides are browned. Add more oil if required, while frying.Fry till all the sides are golden. Pan fry on a low flame as the marinade gets browned quickly. Keep the fried achari paneer tikka aside. Remember not to overcook the paneer cubes as then they can become hard or chewy.Serve with onion slices, lemon wedges and mint yogurt chutney. Sprinkle chaat masala and lemon juice on the achari paneer tikka while serving.

Then place them in a clean plate or kitchen towel and let them dry naturally at room temperature. You can even wipe dry them very well with a clean kitchen cotton towel or napkin.Before beginning with the recipe making, do make sure that your hands, chopping board, knife, kitchen towels, bowls, spoons and jar are clean and moisture free. Later take each lemon and cut four sides but keeping the lemon intact and whole. Do not cut through completely. Cut all lemons this way.Squeeze a bit of juice – about ¼ to ½ teaspoons from each lemon piece into a bowl. But do not squeeze the lemons too much – you want them to keep their shape and fullness. Set the bowl of lemon juice aside to use later. Adding some lemon juice helps to preserve the pickle.If the seeds drop when you squeeze the juice, then remove them with a small spoon and discard. If the seeds remain in the lemon, then simply let them be. No need to remove them. Making spice mixIn another plate or bowl, take 1 tablespoon carom seeds (ajwain), ½ tablespoon red chili powder and 1 tablespoon salt.Mix very well and set aside.Stuffing the mixed spicesNow with your fingers or a small spoon stuff this spice mix in each lemon. Set aside.Place the lemons in a clean glass jar. You can sun dry the empty jar for 1 to 2 hours if you want.Now remove the seeds and pour the lemon juice which was in the bowl in the jar.Add leftover spice mix if any on the stuffed lemons in the jar.Sprinkle some salt (about ½ to 1 teaspoon) all over the lemons. This is essential so that the lemons don't spoil during the pickling process.Cover with a lid and keep the jar in sunlight for 4 days. Every day shake the jar. The tangy lemon pickle will be ready after 4 to 5 days and then you can serve it with your meals.StorageStore the lemon pickle in an air-tight jar in your refrigerator. Do not keep it at room temperature. When you want to serve, remove it with a clean dry spoon. Close the lid of the jar and keep it back in the refrigerator. This lemon pickle keeps well for a month when refrigerated.

Its color will also lighten.Add ¼ cup chilled fresh curd (dahi).Again with a spoon or spatula or a small wired whisk, mix and whip the curd with the creamed ghee.Cream till light and smooth.Making badusha doughNow using a sieve, take the all-purpose flour in it. Place it on the bowl itself. You can also sift the flour separately in a plate or tray.Add 1 pinch salt, 1 pinch baking soda and ½ teaspoon baking powder.Sift directly in the creamed ghee and curd.Mix the flour lightly with the creamed ghee and curd using  a spoon or spatula.Sprinkle some cold water in parts and begin to mix it. Overall you can use 8 to 9 tablespoons cold water. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water at a time and mix.Mix and combine everything to form a soft dough. Do not knead. Just mix and bring everything together to a dough. In case the dough becomes sticky, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Use light pressure from hands and form a dough. At this point, do not knead heavily or if required then knead very lightly.Cover the dough and keep aside for 15 minutes.Making sugar syrupMeanwhile make sugar syrup. While frying balushahi also you can make sugar syrup. Take 200 grams sugar or 1 heaped cup of sugar in a pan or bowl. Use a bowl or pan with more surface area so that the balushahi can get enough space for soaking.Add ½ cup water and mix.Place the pan on a low heat.Using a spoon stir the sugar so that it dissolves. If there are impurities in the sugar syrup, then add 1 tablespoon milk. Remove the scum that forms at the top.When all the sugar has dissolved, add ½ to 1 teaspoon green cardamom powder. Then add 10 to 12 saffron strands. Stir and mix again.Simmer the sugar solution on a low to medium-low heat. Do stir occasionally. To avoid crystallization of sugar, you can add some drops of lemon juice.Simmer till the syrup becomes sticky or you get ½ string consistency in the syrup. You can even cook it to 1 string consistency.The sugar syrup should be sticky. So cool syrup in a spoon and touch it and it should feels sticky. When the syrup becomes sticky, then switch off heat.Frying balushahiBefore frying balushahi you can begin to heat oil in a kadai or pan on a medium heat. You can also use ghee instead of oil to fry balushahi.Do use a kadai with handles at the sides. Pinch small to medium-sized balls from the dough. Roll them gently and lightly between your palms.Then make an indent or depression in them. You can flatten them slightly if you want. Make 5 to 6 badhusha depending on the size of kadai.Cover the remaining dough and keep aside. Check a tiny piece of the badhusha dough in the medium hot oil. It should come up gradually and steadily.Now lift the kadai from stove top and keep it on the kitchen table top. Gently begin to place balushahi in the hot oil.Be careful when you are keeping the balushahi in hot oil. Add 5 to 6 or 7 balushahi depending on the size of kadai. The badushah will expand in oil while frying, so make sure not to over crowd the kadai or pan.Now lift the kadai and place it again on a low heat.Begin to fry badusha on a low heat.When one side firms up and is light golden, turn over each badusha.Keep on turning them over at intervals and frying them on a low heat.Frying balushahi on a low flame takes about 12 to 15 minutes. This will depend on the size, thickness of kadai and the intensity of flame. It took me 14 minutes to fry each batch of 6 balushahi.Fry till golden and crisp.Using a slotted spoon remove them draining the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. When the first batch is getting fried, you can make balushahi from the dough and keep them ready to fry in the second round. Keep the shaped and prepared balushahi covered with a kitchen napkin. Then fry the second batch of balushahi in the same way.Making balushahiAfter a couple of minutes, when fried balushahi are still hot, place them in the hot or warm sugar syrup.With spoon or tongs turn over each badusha, so that both sides are coated with sugar syrup. Let these badusha soak in the sugar syrup for about 14 to 15 minutes.After 14 to 15 minutes, using tongs or spoon, lift each balushahi and place it in a serving tray or bowl. In the same sugar syrup, now add the second batch of balushahi.Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of pistachios all over. You can even sprinkle some saffron strand, rose petals and cardamom powder if you want. Press the pistachios, so that they stick to the sugar syrup on the badusha.Fry the remaining badusha and then soak them in the sugar syrup. In case if sugar syrup crystallizes then add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm or heat the syrup again on a low flame.Serve Balushahi as a sweet. Leftovers can be easily stored in an air-tight jar or container at room temperature for about 5 to 6 days.",NutritionCalories: 111kcal | Carbohydrates: 12g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 6g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.3g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 7mg | Sodium: 21mg | Potassium: 39mg | Fiber: 0.5g | Sugar: 0.3g | Vitamin A: 6IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 0.02mg | Vitamin B12: 0.01µg | Vitamin C: 0.1mg | Vitamin D: 0.004µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 0.2µg | Calcium: 13mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 27µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 5mg | Phosphorus: 30mg | Zinc: 0.1mg

Later drain the water very well and set the lentils aside.Grate half of a medium to large coconut and keep aside. You need about 1.5 cups of tightly packed finely grated coconut.Cooking riceAfter 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and pressure cook the rice with 1.75 to 2 cups water for 2 whistles or 5 to 6 minutes on medium to medium-high heat in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker.If you do not have a pressure cooker, cook rice in a pot or pan or the Instant Pot. Find the details below.Cooking in a pot or pan: Take the soaked rice and 2 cups of water in a pan. Cover and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until rice grains are tender and the water has been absorbed. If the most of the water has evaporated and the rice grains look undercooked, add a few tablespoons of hot water. Cover and continue to cook rice.Cooking in Instant Pot: Transfer the rice grains and 1.5 cups water in the Instant Pot. Seal the lid and position the valve to sealing. Pressure cook on high pressure for 4 to 5 minutes. When the cooking is complete and you hear the beep sound, wait for 5 minutes before giving a quick pressure release. Open the lid and transfer the rice to a tray or plate for cooling.When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and fluff the rice. For a softer texture in the rice, pressure cook for 3 whistlesTake the rice in a plate/tray and allow to cool grains completely. You can also cool the rice in the cooker itself. If there are lumps in the rice, then break the lumps once the rice is cooled.Making temperingHeat coconut oil in a pan. You can also use sesame oil or any other neutral oil. Reduce the heat to a low. Crackle mustard seeds first in the hot oil. Add the chana dal and urad dal. Stir and fry for about a minute.Then add chopped cashews.Stir and fry till the cashews turn golden. The lentils would also turn golden by then.Add red chilies, curry leaves and chopped green chilies along with a pinch of asafetida.Stir and fry until the red chilies change color and the curry leaves become crisp.Making coconut riceNext add grated coconut. Mix very well.Sauté the coconut for 3 to 4 minutes stirring often. The coconut can be sautéed until it get a cream-ish color or a faint light beige color.Lastly add the steamed rice and salt.Combine and mix the rice well. Switch off the heat.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe coconut rice hot or warm. If you like you can garnish with chopped coriander leaves and drizzling with a bit of ghee while serving. You can also choose to drizzle some lemon juice on the rice while eating.You can serve coconut rice as is or pair with a gravy or curry like vegetable stew, potato roast, vegetable kurma, cauliflower kurma, potato curry or moong lentils curry or a simple dal and even plain homemade fresh curd or yogurt. I suggest pairing with gravy or curry for a really flavorful meal. Accompany some papadum (appalam) if you like.Since this rice has coconut, it is best had fresh. I do not recommend to store this rice in the fridge as the chances of coconut going rancid are very high. Moreover it is best to eat rice when freshly cooked.

304,Amchur Powder | Amchoor (Dry Mango Powder),Made from scratch homemade Amchur Powder or Amchoor (also known as Dry Mango Powder) which is often added to North Indian recipes for a slight tang and sourness. Can be made in two ways – by sun drying or dehydrating in the oven.,15minutes,0minutes,21hours,1,Small Jar,Spices,North Indian,"Gluten Free, Vegan","▢ 3  mangoes raw, green, unripe, small-sized or 2 medium-sized mangoes","Prepare MangoesBefore you begin ensure to use clean and dry spoons, plates, tray, knife, peeler and grinder jar.Rinse and wipe the raw unripe mangoes completely dry.Peel the skin. This is the toughest part. Use a good sturdy peeler.With the same peeler, peel the mangoes into thin strips or chips.The strips or chips have to be thinly peeled. Peeling the mango flesh is easier than peeling the skin.Spread the thin peeled mango strips on a tray or a large plate.You can also use 2 to 3 trays or plates to make the drying easier.Two ways to dry the mangoesSun drying methodKeep the mango strips or chips in sun for few days. Usually it takes 2 to 3 days to dry them in the hot sun of North India. But the time can vary depending upon the sun duration and intensity.Oven methodHeat your oven to its minimum. Place the mango strips in the oven. Depending on the temperature it may take anywhere between 10 hours to 2 days or more.I heated the oven at 60 degrees Celsius and kept the mangoes to dry in the oven for 7 hours each, for three days. It took me about 21 hours for the mango strips to dry completely.In the night, I would keep the tray covered with a muslin in a dry place. After they are dried and dehydrated, the mango strips become crisp and snap easily like a thin potato wafer. As soon as they cool, powder them in the grinder.If you keep for more time after they have cooled, then some of the chips loose their crispness and get a chewy texture. Then, you will have to dry them again in the oven for a few hours till they become crisp.A few chips which may have been peeled thickly, may be thick and not crisp. But if they dry properly, they easily get powdered.Making amchur powderAs soon as the mango strips cool, add them to a dry grinder or spice grinder. Grind to a fine powder.Remove and store Amchur Powder or Dry Mango Powder in a jar. 3 small mangoes yielded 75 grams of Amchoor Powder. Store at room temperature in a clean dry glass jar or a BPA free plastic jar in a cool dry place. You can also store in a refrigerator.The homemade amchur powder keeps well for 6 months and if used and stored correctly can last for more than 6 months.Use Amchur Powder in your recipes, as required.

These Dahi ke Kabab are made with curd or yogurt, gram flour, onions, ginger, chilies, coriander leaves and spices.",8hours,15minutes,8hours,6,Dahi Kabab,Snacks,North Indian,"Gluten Free, Vegetarian","▢ 1.5  cups  Curd – 375 grams curd or 200 grams hung curd, about 8 to 9 tablespoons hung curd or greek yogurt – fresh and cold▢ 5  tablespoons  gram flour (besan)▢ 2  tablespoons  finely chopped onions▢ ½  teaspoon  finely chopped ginger▢ ½  teaspoon  finely chopped green chillies▢ 1  tablespoon  finely chopped coriander leaves▢ ½  teaspoon  Cumin Powder (ground cumin)▢ ½  teaspoon  Garam Masala▢ ¼  teaspoon  black pepper powder (ground black pepper) or white pepper powder▢ ½  teaspoon  salt  or add as required▢ 2  tablespoons  oil – for pan frying or add as needed","Preparing hung curdFirst keep a strainer on top of a deep bowl. Line a muslin or a cotton napkin on the strainer. Add the fresh cold curd. The curd has to be thick and creamy and not watery or thin.Bring the edges of the muslin together and tie one edge tightly around the rest. Place a heavy weight or heavy bowl or lid on the tied muslin. Next day, the whey will be drained and there will be thick and creamy hung curd. With the nutrient rich whey, you can add it to chapati dough or make pulao or curries with it. Now remove the hung curd in a mixing bowl. Use silicon spatula as scraping the curd is easier with it. Set aside or you can keep covered in the fridge till you proceed further.Preparing kabab mixtureHeat a heavy pan or kadai. Add 5 tablespoons besan in it. You can also add 6 tablespoons besan if you are making these kababs for the first time and for easier shaping.Begin to stir and roast the gram flour on a low heat till it becomes fragrant and changes color. It is important to roast the gram flour well, so that you do not get the raw taste of gram flour after frying the kababs. However, do not make the gram flour too browned.Roast for 4 to 5 minutes on a low heat stirring non-stop till the gram flour becomes fragrant and turns golden. Set aside.Take the hung curd in a bowl. Then add finely chopped onions, finely chopped ginger, finely chopped green chillies and finely chopped coriander leaves.Add cumin powder and garam masala powder. You can even use roasted cumin powder.Add the roasted besan and black pepper powder (or white pepper powder).Instead of black pepper powder you can even use ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder. Crushed black pepper can also be added.With a small wired whisk, begin to stir and mix. Do mix very well so that there are no tiny lumps of the besan. When mixing I suggest to use a wired whisk as the lumps break easily. If you use a spoon or spatula, then its takes time to break them. With a silicon spatula, scrape the sides and bring the entire kabab mixture in the center. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Refrigerating makes the kabab mixture firm and thus shaping them is easier.Making dahi kababBefore frying heat 2 tablespoons oil on a skillet or frying pan. Keep the flame to low or medium-low.Now spread a bit of water on both palms and take a portion of the kabab mixture and give it a round shape.Then flatten it. Do not make thick kababs. If you are unable to make kababs, then keep in the fridge for some more time.Place the dahi kabab in the hot oil. Keep the flame to low or medium-low. Make kababs from the entire mixture and place them in the oil.Let the dahi kabab become golden from the bottom and then only flip them. These kabab get browned faster, so do keep an eye while pan frying.When the base is golden, then turn over the dahi kabab. Fry the second side also till golden.Turn over a couple of times and fry till you get a nice golden even crust on both sides. A slight more browning of the kabab is also fine.Remove the pan fried dahi ke kabab and place them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.Serve dahi kabab hot with sprinkled with some chaat masala.

Take all of the finely chopped vegetables in a mixing bowl. You can opt to grate or shred the vegetables.Add the chopped onions, green chilies and ginger.Add all the ground spice powders including salt. Mix everything very well.Now add cup besan (gram flour).Combine and mix thoroughly. Set aside this mixture for 5 minutes.Add water in small portions to make a thick flowing batter. I added ¼ cup water.Note that with the kind of vegetables you use, the amount of water will vary. For leafy greens and watery vegetables, add very little water or you may not need to add any water at all.Deep frying Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or frying pan. When the oil becomes hot, then drop spoonfuls of the batter in the oil. Fry the pakora on medium to medium-high heat.Use any neutral flavored oil with a high smoking point to deep-fry. When one side of the pakora firms up, looks cooked and is light golden, turn over gently and fry the other side.Turn over a couple of times and fry the vegetable pakora until they are crisp and golden.Once done, then remove them with a slotted spoon draining as much oil as possible in the pan. Place on kitchen paper towels to remove extra oil. Fry the pakoras in batches this way.Serve vegetable pakora with any chutney or sauce of your choice. I usually prepare mint chutney or coriander chutney to serve with them. You can also have them with roti or bread or sandwich them between bread slices.They make for an excellent evening tea time snack. Best to have them hot with a cup of tea and an accompanying green chutney of your choice.Serving SuggestionsServe mix vegetable pakora with any chutney or sauce of your choice like Mint Chutney, Green Chutney, Coconut Chutney, Cilantro chutney or Tomato Ketchup.These crisp veggie fritters also make for a nice evening snack with a side of Masala Chai or Ginger Chai or even Filter Coffee.They can also be had with Roti or with Bread. You can also sandwich them between bread slices and have as an evening tea time snack.Storage and LeftoversPakoras are best served hot. I suggest to fry a portion from the batter as much as you need. Refrigerate the leftover batter in a covered bowl or container for a few hours or up-to a day. Stored, leftover pakora looses their crispiness and do not taste the same like piping hot pakoras.",NutritionCalories: 206kcal | Carbohydrates: 14g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 15g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 420mg | Potassium: 270mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 2038IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 20mg | Vitamin E: 6mg | Vitamin K: 17µg | Calcium: 20mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 17µg | Iron: 5mg | Magnesium: 9mg | Phosphorus: 19mg | Zinc: 1mg

Measure in a cup. Add them to a bowl of hot water. Cover and soak for 30 minutes. Drain and peel garlic. The skins come off easily after soaking!  Rinse thoroughly in water again. Drain all water. Spread on a plate. Let dry naturally or wipe dry with clean kitchen towel.Note that the garlic has to be completely dry before you begin with the recipe. Any moisture on the garlic will spoil the pickle.If the garlic cloves are large, chop them in half, otherwise you can keep them whole. Ensure that your use the garlic cloves which do not have any fungal spots on them and are clean, shiny to look at. Slice and discard of the parts which have any brown spots or marks.Throw away the garlic cloves where you can see a layer of fungi or where the cloves have become powdery. Coarsely Powder SpicesIn a smaller mixer or spice grinder take the mustard seeds (black or yellow) and fenugreek seeds.Crush the seeds to a coarse or semi-fine mixture. Do not make a fine powder. Set aside. Fry GarlicOnce you are sure the garlic is well dried, heat mustard oil in a frying pan or skillet on medium heat.When oil is medium-hot, reduce the heat to lowest setting. Add the peeled and dried garlic cloves. Stir, mix and fry them in the oil for 3 to 4 minutes or until pale golden. Do not brown garlic, as the cloves become dense and chewy when pickled. They should only be partially cooked.Place pan on countertop. The oil will stop sizzling gradually. Add Spices and SaltFirst add the coarsely ground mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds. Add fennel seeds and nigella seeds (kalonji).Then add the turmeric powder, asafoetida (hing), Kashmiri red chili powder and edible food grade rock salt or pink salt. TIP: If using red chili powder or cayenne start by adding 1 to 1.5 teaspoons as it can make for a spicy pickle. Instead of Kashmiri red chili powder, you can also use sweet paprika. For the salt, start with 1 teaspoon. Mix well and check taste. If needed, add ½ to 1 teaspoon more salt. TIP: If using regular white salt, you will need to add less – about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons total. Asafoetida is optional and you could skip adding. Check the notes section below for more info. Mix and combine very well.Add 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or white vinegar. Mix well. Check taste and, if needed, add more salt or red chili powder. Pickle GarlicTransfer pickle to a clean, dry, sterilized glass or ceramic jar.Lastly, cover the top layer of pickle with 3 tablespoons mustard oil. The oil should be at room temperature.Tightly cover garlic pickles with lid and place in sunlight for 2 to 3 days. Lightly shake the jar everyday without opening the lid.I keep the jar on a window sill which gets plenty of sunlight. If you do not get sunlight, place it in a dry place in your kitchen, though the flavor will not be as intense as the sunlight steeped achaar.Storage After the pickling process is over, place the jar in a dark, dry place. At room temperature, this garlic pickle stays good for about 2 weeks.If you have any pickle remaining after 2 weeks, refrigerate it. Or you could keep it in the refrigerator all the time. It stays good in the refrigerated for about a month. If the top oil layer is removed as you eat the pickles, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of mustard oil again to cover the top layer. This will prevent the cloves from coming into contact with air and spoiling.Serving SuggestionsRemove the pickle with a clean dry spoon every time. Do not add water logged spoon into the pickle. Serve about ½ to 1 teaspoon of the garlic pickle with any Indian main course meal for one. This pickle tastes good with any Indian lunch or dinner be it North, South, East or Western Indian. We like it with a simple Khichdi, Dal Fry served with basmati rice, Sambar and rice, or Pulao.

You can also serve with cumin rice or saffron rice.Although you can serve rajma with any medium or short-grain variety of rice but it tastes best with basmati rice.Making chawal or cooking basmati riceTake the amount of rice that you plan to serve. I have taken 1 cup heaped basmati rice (200 grams).Take the rice in a bowl and begin to rinse the rice grains in running water till the water is clear of starchSoak the rice grains in ¾ to 1 cup water for 20 to 30 minutes. After keeping the kidney beans to cook in the pressure cooker, you can begin with the rinsing and soaking of rice.Later drain all the water from the rice and set asideFor 1 cup of rice, pour 2 cups water (500 ml) in a heavy thick deep bottomed pan. Use the proportion of 1:2 of rice and water depending on the quantity of rice you are using. Also, use a wide deep pan so that the water does spill out while cooking. Note that the amount of water to be added depends on the quality and quantity of rice. Sometimes some strains of basmati rice get cooked quickly in less water. In this case, you can add 1½ to 1¾ cups of water for 1 cup of rice.Add ¼ teaspoon salt or as per your taste. You can also add ½ teaspoon oil or butter or ghee. Adding any fat like oil or butter is optional. Let the water come to a boil on a medium to medium-high heat.Then add the rice and gently stir with a fork. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Do check once or twice when the rice is cooking.In case the rice grains look undercooked and the water has dried up, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons hot water. Stir gently with a fork then lower the flame and cook the rice till all the water has been absorbed and the rice grains have cooked well.Usually, rice takes about 7 to 8 minutes for the rice grains to be tender, soft and fluffy. However keep in mind that the cooking time will vary with the type or variety of rice grains, quality of the pan and the intensity of the heat.After the rice is cooked give a resting time of 5 minutes before you open the lid. Then open the lid and gently fluff the rice with a fork. For a detailed step by step method of making basmati rice you can check this post – How to cook basmati rice in a pot or pan.While serving, spoon the rice in a serving plate. Pour the rajma gravy on top of the rice. Serve with a side of some chopped lemons, sliced onions and/or chopped tomatoes.

Hold a small piece of natural wood charcoal with metal tongs tightly and place it on a flame proof metal rack over the gas flame. Heat carefully until red-hot, turning it with the tongs so it heats evenly. Note: Use only natural wood or coconut shell charcoal. Avoid synthetic, instant-light, or barbecue briquettes. Be careful when heating, as charcoal can splutter when very hot.Once the charcoal is red-hot, place it carefully in the steel bowl with the help of tongs. Drizzle the oil or ghee over the hot charcoal.Cover the pan immediately, and let the smoke infuse for about 4 to 5 minutes.Remove the bowl and discard the charcoal.

The gravy will thicken, so add a splash of water or milk while reheating.Gently reheat on the stovetop over low heat. Avoid boiling, especially after adding cream.Freezing is not recommended, as the paneer may turn rubbery and the cream based gravy may split upon thawing.",NutritionCalories: 380kcal | Carbohydrates: 13g | Protein: 10g | Fat: 33g | Saturated Fat: 11g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 15g | Cholesterol: 41mg | Sodium: 361mg | Potassium: 246mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 5g | Vitamin A: 582IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.05mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 0.5mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin B12: 0.01µg | Vitamin C: 10mg | Vitamin D: 0.1µg | Vitamin E: 7mg | Vitamin K: 8µg | Calcium: 280mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 16µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 38mg | Phosphorus: 78mg | Zinc: 1mg

425,Gulab Jamun With Milk Powder,"This Gulab Jamun With Milk Powder is a cheat's version but tastes equally good. The recipe comes handy if you don’t have khoya or paneer/chenna readily available. All you need is milk powder, curd (yogurt), sugar and water to make a tasty homemade batch of this famous Indian sweet.",30minutes,20minutes,50minutes,14,Milk Powder Gulab Jamuns,Sweets,North Indian,Vegetarian,For the Jamun▢ 1  cup  milk powder▢ ¼  cup  all-purpose flour▢ 1  teaspoon  oil  OR ½ teaspoon ghee▢ 1 pinch salt  (optional)▢ 1 pinch baking soda▢ 1 to 2  tablespoons Curd (yogurt)▢ 1 tablespoon pistachios – blanched or almond slices; for garnish,"Making Sugar SyrupFirst mix the sugar, water, cardamom powder and saffron in a pan and keep it on the stovetop.Gently bring to a boil and continue to stir occasionally.Add some pistachios in the syrup. An optional step but tastes good. Make a thick sticky syrup and turn off the stovetop; much before the sugar solution reaches a one thread consistency.You can cook the sugar syrup till it reaches a half string consistency. On cooling, if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.Making Milk Powder Dough BallsMix the milk powder, all-purpose flour or maida, a pinch of baking soda, a pinch of salt (optional) in a mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon oil OR ½ teaspoon ghee and 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh curd or yogurt.Just mix everything lightly. Add some more curd if the mixture looks dry. Don’t over mix or knead. You don’t want gluten to form, so just mixing well is enough. The all-purpose flour is just added to bind the mixture. If gluten forms then the dough balls become dense and won’t absorb any of the sugar syrup and the jamun will not be soft.The mixture will be sticky but smooth. Apply some oil on your palms and make small balls from the dough. These dough balls almost double when frying and also increase when soaked in the sugar syrup. So don’t make large sized balls.There should be no cracks on the dough balls. They should be smooth. If there are cracks, then just add some 1 or 2 teaspoons of curd or milk to the mixture and continue making the balls.Once done, then cover the balls with a kitchen towel.Frying Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or a pan. When the oil becomes medium hot, lower the heat. Add a small ball in the oil. The ball should slowly rise to the top from the bottom. If it does not rise then, the oil is not hot enough. If it rises quickly and browns also quickly, then the oil is too hot to fry.If the small ball does not crack or break while frying, you are alright to proceed further. If it cracks, then just add some 1 or 2 teaspoons flour to the dough and form the balls again. In an ideal case, the dough ball should not crack and should rise slowly to the top and should not get browned quickly.When you know the oil is hot enough and on a low heat or medium-low heat, then add 3 to 4 balls or more depending on the capacity of your kadai or pan. When the sides touching the oil, become light golden or golden, turn over the dough balls with a slotted spoon and fry the remaining sides. The balls have to be stirred with a slotted spoon frequently to get even browning. But take care as hot oil is there in the pan. The balls should also not become browned too soon. They have to be cooked from the inside too.Keep on turning the balls until they become golden. If the oil becomes cold, then don’t fry the balls. Increase the temperature and then fry. Otherwise, the balls would have a hard crisp thick cover when fried in a less hot oil and they won’t absorb the sugar syrup. Plus they would absorb a lot of oil too.Soaking jamun in sugar syrupWhen the balls are evenly golden and browned, remove from the slotted spoon and add them directly into the sugar syrup.Keep the fried golden balls in the sugar syrup for at least 1 to 2 hours before serving. This is done so that the jamun soaks up the sugar syrup which will make them soft and sweet. That’s why in the sweet shops, the gulab jamun are always soaked in sugar syrup.If you feel the jamun is not soaking in the sugar syrup, then warm the gulab jamuns together with the sugar syrup on stove-top for a couple of minutes. Cover and set aside. Just warm the sugar syrup, don’t heat.Gulab jamun can be served warm or cold. If they are at room temperature, then warm in the microwave and serve them topped with sugar syrup and garnished with pistachios or almond slices.",NutritionServing: 1gulab jamun | Calories: 144kcal | Carbohydrates: 27g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 3g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 9mg | Sodium: 59mg | Potassium: 133mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 25g | Vitamin A: 85IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 90mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 7µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 10mg | Phosphorus: 75mg | Zinc: 1mg

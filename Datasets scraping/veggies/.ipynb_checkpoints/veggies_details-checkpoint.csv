Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices. Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls.Make all veggie balls this way and set aside.Frying veggie ballsHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.

If the ball breaks, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all-purpose flour.Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside.

Stir and mix very well.Add 1 to 1.25 cups water. Let the mixture come to a boil.Mix the cornflour paste again in the bowl (as the cornflour settles at the bottom) and then add in the pan.As soon as you add cornflour paste, mix very well so that there are no lumps.Continue to stir and mix when the veg manchurian gravy is cooking. Simmer till the sauce thickens and you see a glaze in it.There should be no raw taste of the cornflour in the sauce. Cooking sauce or gravy takes about 3 to 4 minutes on a medium heat. If the sauce is too thick, then you add some water. If it is too thin, then you can add some cornflour.When the veg manchurian sauce thickens, add ½ teaspoon black pepper powder.Season with a bit of salt. Do keep in mind that the soy sauce, chilli sauce and tomato ketchup already has salt in it. So add less salt and as per your taste preferences.Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar.

This rustic, comforting recipe is a Punjabi classic, usually served hot with roti or paratha.",20minutes,10minutes,30minutes,2,,Side Dish,"Indian, North Indian, Punjabi","Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian",▢ 1 eggplant – large purple variety known as bhartha baingan in India (aubergine or brinjal)▢ ½ cup or 1 medium sized onions  – finely chopped▢ 1 cup or 2 medium sized tomatoes  – finely chopped▢ 1 heaped teaspoon garlic – finely chopped or 5 to 6 medium-sized garlic cloves▢ ½  teaspoon green chillies – chopped or serrano pepper▢ ¼ teaspoon Red Chili Powder or cayenne or add as required▢ 2 tablespoons oil – can use mustard oil or peanut oil or sunflower oil▢ 1 tablespoon coriander leaves – chopped (cilantro)▢ salt as required,"Roasting EggplantRinse the eggplant in water and then pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Cut the eggplant from its base up-to an inch away from the stem without breaking it apart.Cut on four sides or directions as shown in the step-by-step guide above. The eggplant has to be whole when you place it on the stove-top.Pull apart the cut sides gently and check for worms or any black spots. Discard the eggplant if you see any worms in it.If the eggplant looks clean and without worms, then proceed further. Optionally you can spread a light layer of oil all over it. Keep it for roasting on direct flame on the stove-top. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium.Note that as the eggplant cooks some of the juices and drippings will fall which you can wipe later. I don’t recommend placing or covering the sides of the stove-top burner with aluminum foil as they can burn and be dangerous.You can also grill the eggplant in the oven. But then do note that you won’t get the smoky flavor in the eggplant.Secure the eggplant between tongs and keep on turning it after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that it is evenly cooked.Roast the eggplant till its completely cooked and tender. With a fork or knife check the doneness. The knife should slide easily in aubergine without any resistance. Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools.Smoking Eggplant (Optional Step)You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the eggplant. This is an optional step. Use natural charcoal for this method. Carefully heat a small piece of charcoal on flame with the help of tongs or by placing it in a wired metal fire-proof rack above the flame, till it becomes smoking hot and red.Make small cuts on the roasted eggplant with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 1.5 minutes. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is cooked, just like the way we do for dal tadka.Whether you have charcoal smoked the eggplant or not, peel the charred skin when it cools. Chop finely or you can even mash it.Making Baingan ka BhartaIn a kadai or frying pan or skillet, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.Stirring often, sauté the onions till they soften and translucent. Don't brown them.Add chopped green chillies and chopped tomatoes. Mix well.Sauté the tomatoes stirring often, till the oil starts separating from the mixture.The tomatoes should become pulpy, soft and oil should release from the masala mixture. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix again.Add the chopped or mashed eggplant. Mix thoroughly.Season with salt. Stirring often saute for some 4 to 5 minutes on low to medium-low heat.Finally stir in the coriander leaves or garnish bharta with them. Serve baingan bharta with phulka, roti or chapati. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.You can also pair it with any North Indian meal or mains.

The highlight of this Idli Sambar recipe is the use of freshly roasted and ground spices, along with tomatoes that add depth and enhance the overall flavor.",20minutes,30minutes,50minutes,5,,"Breakfast, Brunch",South Indian,Vegan,For cooking lentils▢ ¼ cup tur dal (husked & split tuvar dal or pigeon pea lentils)▢ ¼ cup masoor dal (husked & split red lentils)▢ ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)▢ 1.25 to 1.5 cups water – for cooking in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker,"Cooking the lentilsRinse both the lentils well and then add them in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker with 1.25 to 1.5 cups water and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.Pressure cook the lentils for 7 to 8 whistles or 11 to 12 minutes until the lentils have softened and well cooked. You can also cook the lentils in a pan on a stove top or in the instant pot. I recommend to soak the lentils for about 30 minutes in enough water prior to cooking them in a pan. This helps in the faster cooking of the lentils.Once the pressure settles down naturally in the cooker, open the cooker. Mash the lentils with a wired whisk and spoon. Keep aside.Making tiffin sambar powderIn a small and heavy frying pan, heat 2 teaspoons oil. Keep the heat to a low. First, add the mustard seeds. Then add the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, black pepper, chana dal (bengal gram), fenugreek seeds, curry leaves and dry red chillies. On a low heat stir non-stop and roast till the spices become aromatic and golden.Keep aside to cool. Don’t burn the spices.Once the spices cool, grind them to a powder in a dry grinder or coffee grinder. Keep aside.Preparation for idli sambarSoak the tamarind in warm water for 25 to 30 mins.Later squeeze the tamarind in the soaked water and extract the tamarind pulp. You can strain tamarind pulp and keep aside.Chop all the veggies. Quarter the onions or halve the pearl onions. Peel and dice the carrots and potatoes.Dice the brinjals and add them in water to prevent discoloration.Chop the tomatoes in small pieces.Cooking veggiesIn a pan, heat oil first. Add the mustard seeds and let them begin to crackle. Then add the urad dal and sauté till they turn to a maroonish color.Add quartered onions or halved pearl onions, curry leaves and asafoetida. Stir and saute for 2 minutes till the onions soften a bit.Add the tomatoes, salt as required and continue to saute for 4 to 5 minutes on a medium-low heat.Then add the veggies which take a longer time to cook (carrots, beans, potatoes, drumsticks etc) and saute for 4 to 5 minutes on a medium-low flame.Then add remaining quick-cooking veggies like brinjals, ladyfingers (okra), pumpkin etc now. Stir and mix. Add the tamarind pulp and 1 to 1.25 cups water. Season with salt as per taste. Mix well. Cover pan and simmer until the raw aroma of the tamarind goes away and the veggies are almost cooked. If the veggies are undercooked, then continue to simmer till they are almost cooked. Making idli sambarAdd the ground sambar powder which we have already prepared. Mix well. Add the mashed dal.Add 1 cup water or as required depending on the consistency you want.Stir and simmer without lid for about 6 to 7 minutes or till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals. Check the taste and add more salt if required.Meanwhile when you keep the dal for pressure cooking, you can steam idli. Both small-sized mini idli or large idli goes well with tiffin sambar.While serving place the idli in a serving bowl. Pour sambar. Garnish with some coriander leaves. You can even drizzle a bit of ghee on top. Serve idli sambar hot.You can also garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with medu vada, idli, dosa, uttapam or even with steamed rice.",NutritionCalories: 219kcal | Carbohydrates: 31g | Protein: 8g | Fat: 8g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 6g | Sodium: 266mg | Potassium: 596mg | Fiber: 9g | Sugar: 6g | Vitamin A: 2796IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.2mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 38mg | Vitamin B6: 0.3mg | Vitamin C: 86mg | Vitamin E: 4mg | Vitamin K: 15µg | Calcium: 86mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 453µg | Iron: 3mg | Magnesium: 55mg | Phosphorus: 119mg | Zinc: 1mg

Firstly soak the leaves in enough water for a few minutes. Add some vinegar and baking soda to the water. This gets rid of pesticides if any.Swish and move them with your hands, so that they are cleaned thoroughly of any soil or mud clinging on the stems. This needs to get washed off. See that the leaves are clean and devoid of any muddy particles on them.Drain all the water and soak them in fresh water for a few more minutes. Drain the water. Repeat this process once or twice. Finally, drain all the water.Now chop the fenugreek leaves. You could do this with a knife or chop them in a food processor.

The liquid should be totally evaporated in the dish and the fenugreek leaves will become completely wilted.Sauté for a couple more minutes to get the potatoes and methi nice and dry.If your potatoes are not quite cooked when the liquid has dried up, add a tablespoon or so of water and continue to cook.Later, if you see any extra water in the pan, then simmer until all the water is dried up.Once cooked, you can either mix in a bit of butter for extra rich flavor or serve plain as-is. Serving suggestionsServe aloo methi with Indian breads like paratha, roti, naan.

Keep heat to a low or medium-low and add 1 pinch asafoetida (hing). Stir and mix with oil. If you do not have asafoetida, then skip it.Then immediately add the stuffed bhindi in the oil and gently stir to combine with the oil.If any masala remains you can add it to the bhindi in the kadai. Also, add the masala which must have fallen on the chopping board while stuffing bhindi.Gently mix and stir again. Cook the stuffed bhindi on a low to medium-low heat.Do not cover the kadai with any lid as this can make the okra slimy. Let the bhindi cook on a low to medium-low heat. We don't want the masala to burn hence the bhindi needs to be cooked on a low to medium-low heat. Also do not add any water.The bhindi should not be on top of each other. Hence arrange them separately in a single layer on the kadai/pan, so that each bhindi is evenly cooked.Ensure that you check the bhindi in between and also give a gently stir after every 3 to 4 minutes. After giving a stir make sure each stuffed bhindi is arranged separately in a single layer. This helps in even cooking.Slow cook until the bhindi is tender and well cooked. At this point, check taste of bhindi and if the salt is less then sprinkle some salt from above and stir to combine.Final TouchesTake the kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) in your palms. Crush kasuri methi between your palms, and sprinkle on the bhindi.If you do not have kasuri methi, then skip adding.Also add garam masala powder. Mix very well and turn off the heat.Lastly, add the chopped coriander leaves and mix again. Instead of coriander leaves you can also use mint leaves.Serving SuggestionsServe Bharwa Bhindi hot or warm, with roti and yogurt or raita. It also goes well with a combination of dal and rice.You can garnish it with coriander leaves while serving. You can even squeeze lime or lemon on the Stuffed Bhindi before you serve.",NutritionCalories: 192kcal | Carbohydrates: 14g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 15g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 12g | Sodium: 609mg | Potassium: 459mg | Fiber: 6g | Sugar: 2g | Vitamin A: 1213IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.3mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.3mg | Vitamin C: 30mg | Vitamin E: 7mg | Vitamin K: 42µg | Calcium: 139mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 76µg | Iron: 2mg | Magnesium: 86mg | Phosphorus: 97mg | Zinc: 1mg

Meanwhile, you can chop garlic and the fresh herbs if using them.The potatoes have to be softened, but they should not fall apart.Check by piercing a knife or a fork and it should pass through the cooked potatoes without any resistance and smoothly.Pour the contents of the pan in a colander and drain the water very well.Cooking milk and butterIn the same pan in which the potatoes were cooked, add ½ cup + 2 tablespoons milk, 2 tablespoons butter and ½ teaspoon finely chopped or minced garlicPlease note that you can add garlic even while boiling potatoes. On a low to medium-low heat begin to heat the pan. Stir occasionally. The butter will begin to melt initially.Let this mixture become hot or come to a gentle boil.Now turn off the heat and add the potatoes in the pan.Mashing potatoesRemove the pan from the stovetop and place on your kitchen countertop. Begin to mash the potatoes with a potato masher or vegetable masher.Note that the masher should have ricer like holes in it as this mimics the ricer while mashing. You can even use potato ricer if you have it instead of the masher. Mash till you get a smooth, fluffy and light consistency. Do not mash too much as this will break down the starches more and make for a gluey, gummy texture. You can always add more butter and some warm milk to get the desired consistency – for example, to get a little more pouring consistency in the mashed potatoes add some more milk.Making mashed potatoesSprinkle some freshly crushed black pepper and a bit of salt. Go easy on the salt as some saltiness will be there in the potatoes – remember we added salt while cooking potatoes. You can always add more salt later.Add 2 to 3 teaspoons of fresh mixed herbs or ½ to 1 teaspoon of dried mixed herbs. I have used a mix of rosemary and parsley here.Fold the herbs, pepper and salt. Do check the taste and add more pepper, salt or butter if required.With a spatula place the mashed potatoes in your serving bowl while still hot or warm. Garnish with some chopped parsley or chives. You can add some cubes of butter also as a garnish. Leftover can be refrigerated for 1 to 2 days and warmed in the oven just before serving. Add some more milk if needed while warming or reheating to adjust the consistency.

These pancakes are crispy and flaky from outside and soft from inside. This Green Onion Pancake recipe is made with whole wheat flour and is vegan.,10minutes,30minutes,40minutes,8,Scallion Pancakes,"Breakfast, Snacks","Chinese, World",Vegan,For Pancake Dough▢ 2 cups whole wheat flour (heaped) – 250 grams▢ ½ teaspoon salt or add as required▢ 2 tablespoons sunflower oil  – peanut oil or melted butter or any neutral flavored oil can be used instead▢ 1 cup water – boiling hot or add water as required,"Making Dough and Prepping ScallionsIn a mixing bowl take whole wheat flour and salt.Mix the salt with the flour.In a saucepan take 1.25 cups of water. Keep pan on a medium to medium-high heat for the water to boil.Let the water come to a boil.Add the boiling hot water in the flour in parts. First add ½ cup of water and mix with a spoon. At this point also add 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil or preferred neutral flavored oil.If required then add more hot water till the mixture starts to leave the sides of the bowl and comes together.I added 1 cup water to get a soft, supple and smooth dough. So go easy while adding water as the water absorption will depend on quality and texture of flour. If using only all-purpose flour, then you may just need to add ⅓ to ½ cup boiling hot water.Let the heat from the mixture become easier to handle and then begin to knead the dough. Knead to soft and supple dough and keep aside covered to rest.If the dough is sticky then add more flour. If the dough is dry then add more water. Mix and knead till all the water is absorbed and dough becomes soft. Cover and keep aside.Rinse the scallion or spring onion stalks in water a few times. Drain all the water. Then finely chop the spring onion greens. You can add a bit of whites too, but finely chop them or else they pop out from the the dough while rolling. Ensure to add more greens and less of the whites. You will need ⅔ to ¾ cup finely chopped scallions.Assembling & Making Green Onion PancakeTake the dough and roll it into a log shape of 10 to 11 inches. Slice the log in 7 to 8 equal parts. Keep the sliced dough circles covered in the same bowl in which the dough was kneaded.Take each part and roll it to a round shape first between your palms. Place it on a rolling board and flatten slightly with your fingers. Sprinkle some flour on the board as well as on the flattened dough.Roll to a large 8 by 10 inches rectangle with a rolling pin. Do not roll the dough too thin. Spread or brush toasted sesame oil all over the dough.Sprinkle the finely chopped spring onions. Also sprinkle a light pinch of salt all over the scallions. Adding salt can be skipped. At this step you can also add black pepper, green chillies for some spicy taste if you prefer. A pinch of sichuan pepper powder or Chinese 5 spice powder can also be sprinkled. For a Indian flavor, you can add a pinch of garam masala.From any side of the rolled dough, gently roll the stuffed dough. While rolling, tighten and then roll. Do not keep the roll loose. It should be a tight roll.Pinch and close the edges.Now hold one of the edges and begin to roll the dough around it in the shape of a spiral. Press and seal the last edge at the sides or beneath the spiral roll. This way make all spiral rolls from the dough and keep them covered.Take one stuffed spiral roll. Sprinkle some flour on the roll as well as on the rolling board.Roll to a slightly thick bread having a 5 to 6 inches diameter.Frying scallion pancakesHeat a skillet or pan – preferable a cast iron skillet or pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil and let it become hot. When the oil becomes hot, gently place the pancake in the oil. When one side is cooked and golden, flip over. Cook the second side.When the second side is fried and you see the crispy, crusty golden spots, flip over.Fry both sides till golden. You can fry a couple a times if the pancakes look undercooked. Fry on medium heat. You can fry for some more time to get a more crispy and crusty layer.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry all the pancakes this way. For frying the next pancake, add ½ to 1 tablespoon oil in the pan.In a similar manner, roll the stuffed spiral dough and later fry the onion pancakes in the skillet in batches.Serve scallion pancakes hot with your favorite dipping sauce.",NutritionCalories: 287kcal | Carbohydrates: 22g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 2g | Monounsaturated Fat: 16g | Sodium: 294mg | Potassium: 132mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 0.3g | Vitamin A: 86IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.2mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin C: 2mg | Vitamin E: 7mg | Vitamin K: 19µg | Calcium: 17mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 19µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 43mg | Phosphorus: 110mg | Zinc: 1mg

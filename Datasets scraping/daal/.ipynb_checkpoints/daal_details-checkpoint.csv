0,Dal Makhani Recipe (Authentic Punjabi Style),"This Dal Makhani recipe is a restaurant style version with subtle smoky flavors and creaminess of the lentils. Dal Makhani is one of the most popular lentil recipes from the North Indian Punjabi cuisine made with whole urad dal (black gram), kidney beans (rajma) and simmered with butter, cream, fragrant spices, creating a luscious, smoky-flavored delicacy best enjoyed with roti, paratha or rice.",8hours,1hour,9hours,4,,Main Course,"North Indian, Punjabi","Gluten Free, Vegetarian",For Cooking Lentils▢ ¾ cup or 140 grams whole urad dal (whole black gram) ▢ ¼ cup or 40 grams rajma (kidney beans)▢ 3 cups water –  for pressure cooking,"Preparation & Cooking LentilsSoak both the whole urad dal and rajma overnight in enough water for 8 to 9 hours or overnight. Later drain them well.Rinse both the lentils a couple of times in water.Drain again and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Add water and stir well.Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are undercooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more. The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for kidney beans too. Keep the cooked lentils and beans aside.In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a fine and smooth puree. Set aside.You can also add ready 1 cup tomato puree instead of blending the tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes while pureeing.Making Dal MakhaniIn a pan, now heat butter. Keep heat to medium-low.Add the whole spices – cumin seeds, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamom, cinnamon and tej patta.Fry for some seconds till the spices sputter and become aromatic.Add finely chopped onions.Stir and sauté the onions on a low or medium-low heat often till they become light golden.Add the ginger garlic paste. Stir again and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.Add the chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute.Add the prepared tomato puree and mix well.Add red chili powder and 2 to 3 pinches of grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder.Mix very well and sauté this mixture on a low to medium flame, till you see fat releasing from the sides.Add the cooked lentils and kidney beans together with the stock. Also add 1 cup water or as needed.Slow CookingMix very well and simmer the dal makhani uncovered on a low heat.Keep on stirring often, so that the lentils don’t stuck to the bottom of the pan.Once it has begun to thicken, add salt as required.Stir very well and continue to simmer on a low heat. Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmering on low heat.When simmering you can add more water if the consistency looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low heat. Do keep on stirring at intervals.When the consistency has thickened enough, add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.Mix the cream very well. Then turn off the heat.Add crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi and mix again. Cover with a lid and set the Dal Makhani aside, if you are proceeding to the dhungar method. Or else you can serve Dal Makhani straightaway.Dhungar Method (Optional)Turn on the stovetop and set the flame to low or medium-low heat. Place a flameproof wire rack with a handle on the stove. I typically use a round metal rack as shown in the step-by-step image above.Keep a small piece of charcoal on the rack and heat it directly over the flame until it becomes hot. Use steel tongs to rotate the charcoal, ensuring it burns evenly.Be cautious while doing this, and if you're unsure, it's okay to skip this step altogether.Keep the red hot charcoal in a small bowl.Pour ½ teaspoon oil on the hot charcoal.Immediately keep this bowl on top of the dal makhani.Cover for a minute and allow the charcoal to infuse its smoke in the dal makhni. Remove the bowl. Stir again. Serve Punjabi Dal Makhani garnished with chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and a few teaspoons of cream with naan, roti, paratha or steamed rice.",NutritionCalories: 308kcal | Carbohydrates: 35g | Protein: 13g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Cholesterol: 35mg | Sodium: 433mg | Potassium: 353mg | Fiber: 12g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 987IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 17mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 7µg | Calcium: 61mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 60µg | Iron: 4mg | Magnesium: 31mg | Phosphorus: 77mg | Zinc: 1mg

You will see fumes emanating as soon as you pour oil or ghee on the hot charcoal.Place this bowl on the dal.Cover the cooker or pot with a lid and let the dal get infused. Only smoke for 1 to 2 minutes. Do not keep for a long time, or you'll risk making the dal taste bitter. Remove the bowl carefully with the help of tongs and cover the cooker with a lid.

Simply add the ingredients in the Instant Pot and pressure cook. An easy and quick way to make this lentil preparation.,15minutes,45minutes,1hour,4,,Main Course,"North Indian, Punjabi","Gluten Free, Vegetarian","For soaking▢ 1 cup black gram (whole urad dal with their husks), 210 grams▢ ¼  cup kidney beans (rajma), 50 grams▢ water as required – for soaking","Soaking lentils and beansRinse the lentils for a couple of times before soaking. Soak both the kidney beans (rajma) and whole black lentils (urad dal) in enough water, overnight if you are making this in the morning. If you are making it in the evening, then soak the lentils in the morning.Later discard all the water from the lentils well and then rinse them with fresh water. Drain the water again.Add the rinsed lentils in the inner cooking pot of the IP. Making tomato pureeTake the chopped tomatoes, chopped ginger and chopped garlic in a blender or mixer jar. Alternatively, you can use 1 cup canned tomato purée and 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste and add directly in the pot. Blend till fine and smooth. Set aside.Cooking in the instant potAdd all the spices powders – turmeric powder, cumin powder, kashmiri chilli powder and Garam Masala or Punjabi Garam masala. Also, add salt as per taste.Now add the blended tomato, ginger, garlic puree and 3 cups water. You can even add finely chopped ⅓ to ½ cup onions at this step. Stir and mix very well.Turn on the Instant Pot. Press the pressure cooker button on high pressure and set the timer to 30 minutes. You can even use the Bean/Chili option of the Instant Pot which has an auto setting of pressure cooking on high pressure for 30 minutes.When the cooking time is completed and you hear the beep sound, wait for 10 or 12 minutes. Then do a quick pressure release (QPR) – carefully lift the pressure valve to remove the extra steam and pressure.Remove the lid. You will see that that the beans and lentils are cooked well, but the consistency of the curry is slightly watery and broth-like. Note that the final consistency should be smooth and creamy. Thus the whole mixture has to be simmered until the consistency thickens a bit and becomes creamy. Keep in mind that the lentils have to be softened and cooked well. You should be able to mash both the urad dal and rajma with a spoon if they are cooked completely. If the lentils are undercooked than pressure cook for some more minutes. Add some water if required. Simmering furtherOnce the lentils have softened and tender, they need to be simmered further. To do this, press the sauté button on Instant Pot and set the time to 7 or 8 minutes on normal setting.Add the butter. Stir and mix to combine.With the back of the spoon mash some of the lentils and beans. Stir often. The stirring will also help in mashing a few of the cooked lentils and beans. Mashing the lentils also helps in making the gravy smooth as well as slightly thickens the consistency.While using the sauté option, you can even set it to the low mode for a slow simmer. But keep on stirring often. Once the consistency is thickened, add cream and kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Mix well. Both these ingredients are optional and you can skip them. Remember the consistency should be neither thick nor thin. If it becomes too thick and then add some water. Also, keep in mind that the consistency will thicken more on cooling.While simmering do stir often so that the lentils do not stick to the bottom of the inner pot. Serve Instant Pot Dal Makhani with Indian Flatbreads like roti, naan bread, tandoori roti or lachha paratha or aloo paratha. You can also serve it with cumin rice or biryani rice. If you like then while serving drizzle some cream or top with some butter.

19,Mung Bean Sprouts | How to Sprout Green Gram,"Delicious, nutritious mung beans are a breeze to sprout at home. Not only do they taste better than store bought, sprouting moong from scratch is much more economical than you might think! Here I share two simple and quick methods for making mung sprouts yourself, no sprout maker needed.",2days,0minutes,2days,1.5,cups,Snacks,World,"Gluten Free, Vegan",▢ ½  cup mung beans▢ 1.5 cups water for soaking – filtered or boiled and cooled,"Rinsing and soaking Mung beansTake the moong beans on a plate or tray. Pick and clean the beans to remove any husks or stones. Rinse the beans in clean water, three to four times using a mesh strainer or colander.Place the rinsed mung beans In a bowl. Add water to cover the moong beans in the bowl.Cover the bowl with a lid and soak the beans overnight or for 8 hours. The next day the moong beans will swell. Drain the water either from the bowl or by using a colander to strain.Thoroughly rinse the beans with clean filtered water, or water that has been boiled and cooled. This step is essential to avoid the risk of contaminating the sprouts.Method oneThis first method is for how to sprout beans in a bowl or large container. Place the soaked beans back into a new clean bowl. Cover again with a lid (not tight fitting or air-tight) at room temperature for 1 to 2 days in a dark place. Check after a day and you will see the the beans begin to sprout. After 2 days you will see beautiful sprouts from the moong beans.Depending on the weather, temperature conditions and the quality of mung beans, the sprouting may happen in a day or may take more time. For long tender sprouts, keep for 2 to 3 days.Do not touch the sprouting beans with your hands or with any spoon or fork to avoid contamination.Method twoThe second method is to sprout the mung beans using a muslin, kitchen cotton towel or cloth.Wet a muslin, cheese cloth, clean cotton cloth or kitchen cotton napkin with clean filtered water, and squeeze the excess water from it. Open the cloth fully. After rinsing and draining the soaked beans thoroughly, place them in the center on this damp cloth. Tie the ends and tighten into a bundle, and place in a clean bowl.Keep loosely covered in a container for 1 or 2 days. Be sure the lid on the container is not too loose and not tight.To check on the sprouting beans, do not open the cloth bundle.After the first day, examine the outside of the kitchen towel. You will see tiny little sprouts or longer sprouts growing out of the cloth fabric, especially if you have used a thin material like muslin or a cheesecloth. For more longer sprouts, you can keep it for one more day. StorageOnce completely sprouted the beans stay fresh in the fridge for 1 or 2 more days.Remove the sprouted beans from the bowl or from the muslin with a clean spoon and place in an air-tight steel container.

A bit of sweet and some sourness in any dish tastes too good and so does in this Gujarati dal. It is a veganrecipe made without onion and garlic.,20minutes,20minutes,40minutes,5,,Main Course,Gujarati,Vegan,For cooking lentils▢ ¾ cup arhar dal (tuvar dal or pigeon pea lentils)▢ 2 to 2.5 cups water or add as needed,"Pressure cooking lentilsFirst pick the arhar dal or pigeon pea lentils for stones etc. Then rinse the lentils thoroughly in running water for 4 to 5 times.Add the rinsed dal in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Add water. Pressure cook for 7 to 8 minutes on a medium to high heat.Read on below in the notes section on cooking lentils in the Instant pot or in a pan. The lentils have to be cooked completely and softened really well. Mash the dal very well with a wired whisk or with a spoon. The lentils should be mashed very well.Making gujarati dalAdd green chili-ginger paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander-cumin powder, jaggery, salt, tomato(optional) and kokums. Mix well.Add water to get a medium to medium-thin consistency. Mix again and keep the cooker back on the stove top.Bring the dal to a simmer on a low heat for 7 to 8 minutes stirring often. For temperingHeat oil or ghee in a small pan. Crackle mustard seeds first and then add cumin seeds.Add the dry red chilies, cloves, cinnamon, curry leaves, asafoetida and fenugreek seeds. Stir and fry for some seconds until the red chilies change color.Carefully, pour this tempering mixture together with the oil in the simmering dal. Switch off the heat. Add coriander leaves. Finally stir the dal.Serve piping hot gujarati dal with steamed rice.Serving SuggestionsGujarati dal is best served with hot steamed rice. Drizzle a bit of ghee on the dal if you like. Have a complete meal by pairing the dal and rice with a side of any Indian vegetable dish or salad or raita or a plain yogurt.You can relish the dal with some soft roti or crispy paratha or even bread or dinner rolls (pav). StorageIt is best to eat Gujarati dal when freshly cooked. Lentils always taste best when served hot and as soon as they are cooked.

I have taken 1 cup heaped basmati rice (200 grams).Take the rice in a bowl and begin to rinse the rice grains in running water till the water is clear of starchSoak the rice grains in ¾ to 1 cup water for 20 to 30 minutes. After keeping the kidney beans to cook in the pressure cooker, you can begin with the rinsing and soaking of rice.Later drain all the water from the rice and set asideFor 1 cup of rice, pour 2 cups water (500 ml) in a heavy thick deep bottomed pan. Use the proportion of 1:2 of rice and water depending on the quantity of rice you are using. Also, use a wide deep pan so that the water does spill out while cooking. Note that the amount of water to be added depends on the quality and quantity of rice. Sometimes some strains of basmati rice get cooked quickly in less water. In this case, you can add 1½ to 1¾ cups of water for 1 cup of rice.Add ¼ teaspoon salt or as per your taste. You can also add ½ teaspoon oil or butter or ghee. Adding any fat like oil or butter is optional. Let the water come to a boil on a medium to medium-high heat.Then add the rice and gently stir with a fork. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Do check once or twice when the rice is cooking.In case the rice grains look undercooked and the water has dried up, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons hot water. Stir gently with a fork then lower the flame and cook the rice till all the water has been absorbed and the rice grains have cooked well.Usually, rice takes about 7 to 8 minutes for the rice grains to be tender, soft and fluffy. However keep in mind that the cooking time will vary with the type or variety of rice grains, quality of the pan and the intensity of the heat.After the rice is cooked give a resting time of 5 minutes before you open the lid. Then open the lid and gently fluff the rice with a fork. For a detailed step by step method of making basmati rice you can check this post – How to cook basmati rice in a pot or pan.While serving, spoon the rice in a serving plate.

Mix well and set aside. Check the taste and add more salt if needed.Keep in mind that the consistency will thicken as ghughni cools.

Then soak the chickpeas in enough water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.Drain the water. Rinse the chickpeas again in fresh water and then add them to a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker.Add whole spices – cinnamon, black cardamom, tej patta and cloves. I have also added dried amla to get the dark color in the chickpeas. Instead of dried amla, you can add 1 black tea bag. You can also simply cook the chickpeas plain with the spices and water.Pour the 2.5 cups of water.Pressure cook the chickpeas for 15 minutes on medium to medium-high heat. Wait for the pressure to drop naturally in the cooker. Then open the lid and check if the chickpeas are cooked well. The chickpeas must be tender, softened and have a melt in the mouth texture. They should mash easily when you press with a spoon. The cooked chickpeas must not give you any slight bite when you eat them.If you do not have a pressure cooker, then cook the chickpeas in a pot with plenty of water or in an Instant Pot. Cooking chickpeas in a pot will take a lot of time though.Remove the amla pieces which would have softened by now or the tea bag from the stock. You can also remove the whole spices from the stock, but I keep them. Keep the cooked chickpeas along with the stock aside.Making chana masalaHeat oil in a kadai (wok) or a pan. Add slit whole green chilies and fry them on medium-low heat until the have some light golden blisters on them.Ensure to slit the green chilies and fry, so that they do not burst in the oil. Note that you could skip frying the green chillies if you prefer. Or opt to add 1 to 2 green chilies in the masala while sautéing. Place the fried green chilies on kitchen paper towels for any excess oil to be drained.In the same oil, add the carom seeds. Sauté for a few seconds until the carom seeds are fragrant.Add finely chopped onions. Stir and sauté until the onions turn translucent or light brown.Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Sauté until their raw aroma goes away.Add turmeric powder, red chili powder and garam masala powder. Mix the spice powders with the sautéed onions and then add finely chopped tomatoes. Stir the whole mixture very well to combine the tomatoes with the mixture. Sauté until the tomatoes soften and the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala.When the oil starts separating from the onion and tomato masala and it looks glossy, at this point add the chickpeas along with the stock (the water in which the chickpeas were cooked).You could also opt to add fresh water instead of the stock.Mix well and then add salt and dry mango powder.Stir again and simmer the curry on medium-low to medium heat. You can also mash a few chickpeas with the back of the spoon to thicken the gravy.Simmer till the gravy has thickened. You will also see some oil specks floating at the top of the gravy.Check the taste and add more salt, red chili powder, garam masala powder or dry mango powder if needed.Lastly add the fried green chilies to the gravy or keep them aside to be used as a garnish. Serve Chana Masala hot garnished with coriander leaves paired with bhatura or pooris or naan or roti.As a side accompaniment serve the Chana Masala with sliced onions, tomatoes and lime or lemon.

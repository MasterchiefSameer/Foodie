In my Samosa recipe, the dough is made with less water for extra flakiness, and the filling is adapted from my culinary school notes; simple, flavorful, and perfectly balanced. You can deep-fry, bake, or air-fry these samosas based on your preference.",45minutes,45minutes,1hour,12,Samosa,"Snacks, Starters","North Indian, Punjabi",Vegetarian,For making samosa pastry▢ 2 cups (250 grams)  all-purpose flour (maida)▢ 1 teaspoon carom seeds▢ 1 teaspoon salt or add as required▢ 6 tablespoons (50 grams)  Ghee (clarified butter)▢ 7 to 8 tablespoons water or add as required,"Making samosa pastry doughTake the flour, carom seeds, salt in a bowl. Mix well and add ghee.With your fingertips rub the ghee or oil in the flour to get a breadcrumb like consistency.The whole mixture should clump together when joined and not fall apart. Add water in parts and knead to a firm dough. If the dough looks dry or floury, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water and knead.Cover the dough with a moistened napkin and set aside for 30 minutes. Making potato and green peas stuffingSteam or boil the potatoes and peas till are cooked completely. Drain them of any extra water in a colander or sieve. Peel the boiled potatoes and chop them into small cubesDry roast all the whole spices mentioned in the above list until fragrant taking care not to burn them.

Assembling & shaping samosaAfter resting the dough for 30 minutes, divide the dough in 6 equal pieces.Take each piece and roll in your palms first to make a smooth ball.Then roll it with a rolling pin keeping the thickness to 1 mm throughout.Cut with a knife or a pastry cutter through the center of the rolled samosa pastry.With a brush or with your finger tips, spread some water all over the edges. Join the two straight ends forming a cone shape. Press the edges so that they get sealed well.Stuff the prepared samosa cone with the prepared potato-peas stuffing.Pinch a part on the edge (check the video & photos). This helps the samosa to stand once it is shaped.Press both the edges. Be sure there are no cracks.Prepare all the samosa this way and keep covered with a moist kitchen napkin.Frying SamosaNow heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Once the oil becomes hot (test by adding a small piece of dough – it should come up quickly once added to the hot oil). Gently slide the prepared stuffed samosa & quickly reduce the flame to low.Turn over in between and fry until golden. Drain the fried samosa on paper towels to remove excess oil.Fry them in batches. For frying the second batch, again increase the temperature of the oil to medium-heat. Do not overcrowd the pan while frying. Add the samosa and then lower the heat, thereby decreasing the temperature of oil.This way fry all the samosa in batches.Serving suggestionsServe samosa hot or warm with coriander chutney, tamarind chutney or tomato ketchup.They can also be served with a yogurt dip or plain raita. Another way is to serve it with  chana masala (chickpea curry).We usually pair samosa with masala chai or ginger chai.Even bread or pav (Indian bread rolls) can be served with it.Whatever you serve this snack with, remember to have hot masala chai with it.",NutritionServing: 1samosa | Calories: 175kcal | Carbohydrates: 18g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 10g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 17mg | Sodium: 205mg | Potassium: 42mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 75IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 3mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 2µg | Calcium: 9mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 42µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 8mg | Phosphorus: 30mg | Zinc: 1mg

With your fingers, mix the oil evenly with the sooji.Now add all purpose flour to this mixture.Mix again very well so that the all purpose flour is mixed evenly.Add 3 tablespoons water first. Mix again. Then add 1 tablespoon water more and begin to knead the dough. Sooji absorbs water while kneading. Add water in parts while kneading.Then add 2 tablespoons more of the water and continue to knead. The kneading is very important in getting the perfect texture. The dough is not soft nor too hard.If you make the dough soft, then add 1 to 3 teaspoon more of the suji. If the dough looks hard, then add sprinkle some water and continue to knead.The suji puri dough should be elastic. Gluten strands need to be formed, which gives a structure and shape to the pooris. The correct texture of the dough, also help in puffing puris and helps in them staying crisp. Knead very well. Elasticity helps in rolling the dough without cracks and thinly. When rolling, the dough should roll easily without any cracks. You should be easily able to lift the rolled dough without it tearing or breaking and falling apart.Knead to a semi soft elastic dough and keep it in a bowl or pan.Cover the dough with a moist kitchen towel or napkin and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes. You can also keep the dough for an hour.After 30 minutes, knead the dough again.Assembling and RollingNow divide the dough into two or three parts. Take one part on your work surface and begin to roll. Avoid adding any dry flour while kneading. Keep the remaining dough covered with the moist kitchen towel.Roll to a large round. There should be no cracks in the rolled dough. You can flip the entire rolled dough without it breaking or tearing apart.Keep on rolling to a thin and even round. The puri have to be thinly rolled. If not thin, the base becomes thick and remains soft even after frying. If the dough is not rolled evenly, then the puri won't puff up.Making Suji Ke GolgappeWith a cookie cutter or a small bowl, cut small to medium discs from the rolled dough. Using a cookie cutter gives even shape and size to the pooris. You can also make small balls and roll them. But then the puri won't have an even and uniform shape.Remove the dough edges and place the small roundels in a plate without them touching each other. Keep these puris covered with a moist kitchen towel.Collect the egdes and knead them lightly. Roll the edges too and make puris the same way.In this way make all the puris and keep them covered in a moist kitchen towel. You can also roll them and fry simultaneously like I have done.Frying Suji PuriHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil should be medium hot. Add a tiny piece of the dough ball in the hot oil. If the ball steadily comes up to the surface, the oil is hot and the pooris can be fried now.Slid a few pooris in the oil. They will puff up quickly as soon as you add them to the hot oil. You can fry up to 4 to 8 pieces at a time, depending on the size of your pan.With a slotted spoon flip them, once they puff up. Even after oil stops sizzling, continue to fry till light golden. Frying this way, gives a crisp texture to the pooris from outside as well as inside. Otherwise, they remain soft from inside and crisp from outside.Fry them till they are a light golden or golden.Drain fried puri on kitchen paper towels. There will be a few flat puris too. These you can use to make sev puri or papdi chaat. Continue to fry all the pooris this way.Drain them on paper towels.Once they get cooled at room temperature, immediately add puris to a jar or box and close the lid tightly.Make pani puri, dahi puri or ragda puri or puchka from these homemade pooris or golgappas. You will get 50 to 60 pooris from this recipe.

Depending on the quality of rava and rice flour, you can add less or more water – from 2 to 2.5 cups water. I added 2.25 cups water.Whisk till smooth without any lumps. The batter has to be flowing and thin. If the batter looks thick or has a medium consistency, then add more water. If the batter looks very thin and runny, then add some rice flour.Cover and let the suji dosa batter rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Once the batter rests, you will see that the rava and the flours have settled down and the water will be floating on top.Making rava dosaBefore preparing dosa, mix the batter very well.

Fold and then serve suji ka dosa hot with coconut chutney and sambar. The flours settles down at the bottom of the batter. So you have to stir and mix the batter very well every time you make dosa. In case the batter becomes thick after making a few dosa, then add some water and stir again.Serve rava dosa with coconut chutney or dosa podi or any chutney of your choice. They also taste good with peanut chutney or tomato chutney or ginger chutney or onion chutney.For best taste and texture I recommend to serve these as soon as they are made.

Add the noodles in hot boiling water and cook them.Once the noodles are cooked al dente, then drain the water from the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in water.Drain any water and set aside.Chop the veggies in thin long strips or matchsticks. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them. Slice the green bell pepper (capsicum) in thin strips or matchsticks. For the french beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally or finely chop them. Chopping takes time, so you can use a food processor to ease up the work.Please note you can use your choice of veggies.Making stuffingNow heat oil in a wok or frying pan. Keep the heat to medium and add the spring onion whites.Stir and then add all the chopped veggies.Increase the heat to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes. If the heat becomes too high while stir-frying, then reduce it and continue to stir-fryAdd crushed black pepper powder, finely chopped celery (optional) and soy sauce.Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste.Mix everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles.Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce is already salty. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.Switch off the heat and add the spring onion greens. Stir and keep the vegetable filling aside. Let it cool at room temperature.Preparing sealing pasteIn a bowl, mix the all purpose flour or cornstarch and water.Whisk very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.Stuffing Spring RollsNow take the spring roll wrapper. If you are using the wrapper recipe which I have shared, then keep the cooked side facing you. Make sure that the wrappers are at room temperature before using them.Now with your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. Then place 1 to 2 tablespoons of the veggie stuffing on one side. For a larger sized wrapper add more of the vegetable stuffing. Wrapping Method 1Gently but tightly roll till the end. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges. If you are using square wrappers, then do check the recipe video in the post to see the wrapping and folding.Wrapping Method 2Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it. While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break. If there is any small tear then just spread some of the batter on it to close it.Now place all the spring rolls with the sealed edges facing down on a plate. Your hands will become messy when stuffing the spring rolls.Deep frying veg spring rollsHeat oil at the deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees Celsius/356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).Gently slid a spring roll in the hot oil. Keep the heat to medium. If the oil is not hot enough, then they absorb oil and become soggy.Depending on the size of the pan or wok, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time.Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.Fry till they are crisp and golden turning over as needed. These spring rolls get fried quickly.Remove the fried veg spring rolls with a slotted spoon.Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining rolls in batches. Garnish veg spring rolls with some chopped spring onion greens or coriander leaves (cilantro) if you like. Serve fried spring rolls hot with any dipping sauce of your choice like chili garlic sauce, hoisin sauce or tomato ketchup.",NutritionCalories: 103kcal | Carbohydrates: 16g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 3g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 2mg | Sodium: 204mg | Potassium: 77mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 671IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 6mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 25µg | Calcium: 21mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 31µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 9mg | Phosphorus: 29mg | Zinc: 1mg

Preparing veggiesNow rinse and steam or boil 3 medium to large potatoes, 1 medium carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓ cup peas till they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the vegetables in a stove-top pressure cooker, Instant Pot or a pan. I have listed the methods below. 1: Stove-top pressure cooker: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots and beans. Place them with the green peas in a pan or bowl. Add 2 cups water in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Place a small trivet inside. Place the bowl with the veggies on the trivet.

Depending on the size of your pan, you can fry from 2 to 4 patties. The veggie mixture makes 4 regular burger sized patties.2 to 3 tablespoons oil works perfectly for frying two patties. For 4 veggie patties, you can add 4 to 6 tablespoons oil. When the base is lightly browned or browned, then flip the patties.Flip a couple of times more till the patties are pan fried evenly and the crust becomes crisp and golden.Drain the veggie patties on kitchen paper towels.Assembling veggie burgerSlice the burger buns in equal halves.Spread some butter on the burger bun slices.Heat a small pan and toast the butter side.The buttered side should become lightly crisp and golden.

If you cannot achieve these string consistencies than just make a sticky syrup.The sugar needs to be kept warm. For this keep the sugar syrup on a hot water bath so that it stays warm throughout and does not crystallize.

The video has the recipe ingredients doubled in proportion.To the same bowl, add urad dal and fenugreek seeds.Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep aside.In a separate bowl, take the flattened rice.Rinse it once or twice in water and then add rinsed flattened rice to the bowl containing the rinsed rice+lentils+methi seeds.Pour 1.5 cups water. Mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 5 to 6 hours.Making dosa batterDrain all the water and add the soaked ingredients in a wet grinder jar.Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of batter is also fine. If the mixer gets heated up, then stop and wait for some minutes. When the mixer cools down, grind again. Depending on the jar capacity, you can grind everything once or in two batches. I ground in two batches and added overall ¾ cup water.Now take the batter in a large bowl or pan.Add ½ tsp rock salt. Mix very well. Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. Time of fermentation will vary depending on the temperature conditions.A proper fermentation will double or triple up the volume of the batter and you will see tiny air pockets in the batter with a light sour aroma.Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa.Making DosaHeat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan. Do keep the heat on low to low-medium heat, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium.Do not spread oil if you are using a non stick pan, as you won’t be able to spread the batter.Now take a ladle full of the batter. Pour the dosa batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards.Cover it with a lid and cook the dosa on a low to medium heat. Do regulate the flame as per the pan size and thickness.When you see the batter on the top has cooked well and the bottom has become crisp and golden, then sprinkle ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil on the edges and center.With the spoon spread the oil on the dosa.Cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp. The base will leave the pan and the sides will also get separated when it gets cooked.Fold and serve sada dosa hot. Make all dosai this way.Serve these crisp plain dosa with sambar or potato masala or coconut chutney.",NutritionCalories: 74kcal | Carbohydrates: 12g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 2g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 75mg | Potassium: 13mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 6mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 3mg | Phosphorus: 15mg | Zinc: 1mg

Pressure cook for 30 minutes on high pressure. After 30 minutes the pressure cooker will beep. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes before releasing the valve.Open the lid and check the potatoes with a fork or knife. The fork should pass easily through the potatoes.Check if the peas are tender and softened.

Also use a well seasoned pan or a non stick pan, so that the paneer cubes do not stick to the pan while frying.I cooked the paneer for about 4 minutes on a medium-low heat. Do not cook too much as then paneer will become dense, cook on medium-low flame.

Don't add too much water as then the fritters become too crispy and soak a lot of oil.Take the ground batter in a bowl and add salt.Stir the batter briskly for a couple of minutes. This brisk stirring makes the batter more light and fluffy.The test to a correct consistency of this batter is the floating test. Take some water in a small bowl. Add 1 tsp of a batter in the water.

Add according to the capacity of the pan or kadai.When they become pale golden, then turn them.Fry the fritters till they become golden and crispy. Turn them a couple of times for even frying.Fry till golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon.Drain on paper towels.

Pick and rinse the dried white peas a few times in water.Soak the peas overnight or for 8 to 9 hours in triple the amount of water.Drain the water. Rinse the white peas in fresh clean water a couple of times and then drain the water.Cooking Ragda in Instant PotTake the peas, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt and oil in the steel insert of the instant pot. Add 2 cups water.Secure and seal with the instant pot lid. Move the valve and secure or keep it at the sealing position. Press the pressure cooking/manual switch and set the time to 30 minutes selecting high pressure. Pressure cook for 30 minutes. When you hear the beep sound after the pressure cooking is complete, then wait for 10 to 12 minutes before lifting the valve to release any pressure. Check to see if the cooked peas are softened. If they are undercooked or have a bite in the center, pressure cook again for 10 minutes on high pressure. When the peas have thoroughly cooked and softened, check the consistency. If its runny or watery, then the ragda needs to be cooked more to get the curry to the desired consistency. Mash some of the peas with a potato masher. This helps to thicken the consistency.Press the 'sauté' switch on the instant pot and set time to 10 to 12 minutes.  Simmer the curry until it gets a medium to medium-thick consistency. Stir often. Check the taste and add more salt or red chilli powder if required.When the ragda has the desired consistency, then switch off the Instant pot. You can now serve it hot or warm.Making Ragda in stove-top pressure cookerIn a 3 litre pressure cooker, add the soaked white peas with the turmeric powder, red chilli powder, asafoetida, oil and salt.Add 2.5 cups water and mix well. Pressure cook for 15 to 20 minutes on medium heat.When the pressure falls in the cooker on its own, then only open the lid and check to see if the peas are tender and softened.These peas take a long time to cook. If they are not cooked completely, pressure cook again for 8 to 10 minutes. Add 1 cup water or as required if needed and pressure cook on medium heat the second time.Once the peas have become soft and mushy, check for the consistency of the ragda.If it is slightly watery, then evaporate the water by cooking the ragda in the pressure cooker without the lid. Stir often. The ragda should not be very thick nor watery. Just slightly thick with a medium to medium-thick consistency.Check the seasonings and adjust accordingly by adding more salt or red chilli powder.Now this ragda can be used as the stuffing for pani puri or to make any chaat snack like ragda pattice or ragda puri. For a simple snack, pour the hot ragda in a bowl. Top it with some finely chopped onions, few pinches of roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, black salt or regular salt. Drizzle some lemon or lime juice and garnish with coriander leaves or mint leaves. You can also add a light sprinkle of some sev (fried gram flour vermicelli) or crushed papdi or crispy golgappa puri.

Drain the water. Rinse the dried peas a few times again with fresh water. Drain all the water and set the soaked peas aside.Making GhugniPlace a 3 litre pressure cooker on the stovetop.Keep heat low or medium-low.When the oil becomes shot, add cinnamon, cardamom, tej patta, dry red chilli and cloves. At this point you can also add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds if you do not add cumin powder later.Allow the spices to crackle on low to medium-low heat ensuring they do not burn.Add in the finely chopped onions.

Also check the consistency of the ghugni.If the peas are al dente or undercooked, pressure cook again for 5 minutes or more. Add water if needed when pressure cooking the second time.If the consistency is runny, keep the cooker on stovetop and simmer ghugni until the consistency thickens.The peas must be softened well and there must not be any bite to them.Remove the red chillies when simmering further as they can soften too much and disintegrate into the curry.The consistency of ghugni is medium—not too runny or thick. It has enough gravy to coat the peas, giving it a smooth, slightly saucy texture that's perfect for serving with poori, paratha, or as a chaat with puffed rice and other toppings.Lastly add bhaja masala or garam masala powder.Add chopped coriander leaves. Mix well and set aside. Check the taste and add more salt if needed.Keep in mind that the consistency will thicken as ghughni cools.

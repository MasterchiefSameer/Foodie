This Veg Manchurian Gravy pairs equally good with a simple noodle dish or even a flavorful fried rice or just a plain simple steamed rice.",40minutes,20minutes,1hour,3,,Main Course,Indo Chinese,Vegan,"For vegetable balls▢ ½ cup carrot – grated▢ ½ cup cabbage – finely chopped  (red or green)▢ ¼ cup green bell pepper – finely chopped (capsicum)▢ ¼ cup spring onions – finely chopped (scallions)▢ ½ teaspoon black peppercorns – freshly crushed or black pepper powder or white pepper powder▢ 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour▢ 2 tablespoons cornstarch (cornflour)▢ ½ teaspoon salt  or add as per taste▢ oil – as required, for shallow or deep frying – sunflower oil or any neutral tasting oil","Making vegetable ballsTake the finely chopped or grated veggies in a bowl. Next add the dry ingredients – cornstarch,  all-purpose flour, black pepper and salt. Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices. Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls.Make all veggie balls this way and set aside.Frying veggie ballsHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veg manchurian balls. If the ball breaks, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all-purpose flour.Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much of oil.When cooked from one side and light golden or golden, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.Fry the balls till crisp and golden turning over as needed for even cooking. Remove them with a slotted or perforated spoon and drain as much as oil as possible.Place the fried veg manchurian balls on kitchen paper towels.Fry the veg manchurian balls this way in batches and keep aside.Making sauce or gravyIn a small bowl take the following three sauces – soy sauce, tomato ketchup and red chilli sauce.Mix the sauces very well and set aside.In another small bowl take 1 tablespoon cornflour and 2 tablespoons water. Mix very well and set aside.Heat 1 to 1.5 tablespoons oil in a pan or wok. Add the chopped spring onions, finely chopped ginger, finely chopped garlic, finely chopped green chilies and finely chopped capsicum.Stir fry on medium flame till the onions turn translucent.Now add the mixed sauces. Stir and mix very well.Add 1 to 1.25 cups water. Let the mixture come to a boil.Mix the cornflour paste again in the bowl (as the cornflour settles at the bottom) and then add in the pan.As soon as you add cornflour paste, mix very well so that there are no lumps.Continue to stir and mix when the veg manchurian gravy is cooking. Simmer till the sauce thickens and you see a glaze in it.There should be no raw taste of the cornflour in the sauce. Cooking sauce or gravy takes about 3 to 4 minutes on a medium heat. If the sauce is too thick, then you add some water. If it is too thin, then you can add some cornflour.When the veg manchurian sauce thickens, add ½ teaspoon black pepper powder.Season with a bit of salt. Do keep in mind that the soy sauce, chilli sauce and tomato ketchup already has salt in it. So add less salt and as per your taste preferences.Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar. Mix very well.Then add the fried veg manchurian balls. Also add 1 teaspoon of rice vinegar or regular vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Gently stir and coat the veg manchurian balls in the gravy.Turn off the heat add chopped spring onion greens.Serve Veg Manchurian Gravy hot garnished with some spring onion greens.

Soak rice in water for 30 mins. Drain and keep aside.In a pot, bring water to a gentle boil with salt and 2 to 3 drops of toasted sesame oil.Add the soaked and drained rice to the hot water.On a low to medium to medium-high heat simmer rice without the lid.When rice becomes al dente or just about cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Strain the rice in a colander or sieve. You can also gently rinse cooked rice in water so that they stop cooking and don't stick to each other. Cover the cooked rice and set aside until the rice cools completely. You can even refrigerate rice with a covered lid for 30 minutes. Chopping veggiesWhen the cooked rice is cooling, chop the veggies finely and keep aside. Remember to chop the french beans very finely. They take more time to cook than other veggies. You can also blanch them first and then cook. Another option is to add the beans first and then add the other vegetables.Making veg fried riceHeat oil in a wok or a pan. First add the star anise and fry for a few seconds or until the oil becomes fragrant.Add the garlic, ginger and sauté for some seconds. No need to brown the garlic. Add the spring onions whites and sauté for about 2 minutes.Then add finely chopped french beans. Stir fry french beans for 2 to 3 minutes over medium to medium-high heat.Add the remaining finely chopped veggies, including mushrooms and celery. Increase the heat to a high to thoroughly cook all of the vegetables.You have to continuously toss and stir while frying so that the veggies are uniformly cooked and do not get burnt.The vegetables have to be stir-fried, until they are almost cooked and yet retain their crunchiness and crispiness. Stir-frying vegetables on high heat takes about 4 to 6 minutes. Add the soy sauce, salt and pepper. Stir quickly and add cooked and cooled rice.Stir fry for a few minutes until the sauce has coated the rice well. Keep a check when adding salt, as soy sauce already has salt in it.Serve the veg fried rice hot as it is or with with your favorite Chinese side. Serving suggestionsThough fried rice tastes great on its own, you can pair it with Veg Manchurian, Gobi Manchurian, Chilli Paneer, Spring Rolls or Chilli Mushroom. More side recipes for veg fried rice are linked and listed in the main post. Storing fried riceVegetable fried rice stays good for a day when refrigerated. But I would recommend it to be eaten as soon as you make it since a few days old refrigerated rice is not good for health. ",NutritionCalories: 394kcal | Carbohydrates: 56g | Protein: 8g | Fat: 15g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Sodium: 1815mg | Potassium: 309mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 2014IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 3mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 17mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 37µg | Calcium: 43mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 29µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 33mg | Phosphorus: 129mg | Zinc: 1mg

Add the noodles in hot boiling water and cook them.Once the noodles are cooked al dente, then drain the water from the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in water.Drain any water and set aside.Chop the veggies in thin long strips or matchsticks. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them. Slice the green bell pepper (capsicum) in thin strips or matchsticks. For the french beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally or finely chop them. Chopping takes time, so you can use a food processor to ease up the work.Please note you can use your choice of veggies.Making stuffingNow heat oil in a wok or frying pan. Keep the heat to medium and add the spring onion whites.Stir and then add all the chopped veggies.Increase the heat to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes. If the heat becomes too high while stir-frying, then reduce it and continue to stir-fryAdd crushed black pepper powder, finely chopped celery (optional) and soy sauce.Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste.Mix everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles.Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce is already salty. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.Switch off the heat and add the spring onion greens. Stir and keep the vegetable filling aside. Let it cool at room temperature.Preparing sealing pasteIn a bowl, mix the all purpose flour or cornstarch and water.Whisk very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.Stuffing Spring RollsNow take the spring roll wrapper. If you are using the wrapper recipe which I have shared, then keep the cooked side facing you. Make sure that the wrappers are at room temperature before using them.Now with your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. Then place 1 to 2 tablespoons of the veggie stuffing on one side. For a larger sized wrapper add more of the vegetable stuffing. Wrapping Method 1Gently but tightly roll till the end. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges. If you are using square wrappers, then do check the recipe video in the post to see the wrapping and folding.Wrapping Method 2Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it. While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break. If there is any small tear then just spread some of the batter on it to close it.Now place all the spring rolls with the sealed edges facing down on a plate. Your hands will become messy when stuffing the spring rolls.Deep frying veg spring rollsHeat oil at the deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees Celsius/356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).Gently slid a spring roll in the hot oil. Keep the heat to medium. If the oil is not hot enough, then they absorb oil and become soggy.Depending on the size of the pan or wok, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time.Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.Fry till they are crisp and golden turning over as needed. These spring rolls get fried quickly.Remove the fried veg spring rolls with a slotted spoon.Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining rolls in batches. Garnish veg spring rolls with some chopped spring onion greens or coriander leaves (cilantro) if you like.

Depending on the quality of flour, you can add less or more water.Making spring roll wrapperNow on a low flame, heat a nonstick pan. The pan should just become slightly hot and not too hot. You can also use a cast iron or steel pan. But make sure they are well-seasoned.With a paper tissue or a small piece of kitchen towel dipped in oil, grease the pan. For the nonstick pan you can skip greasing with oil. But if you feel the wrappers are sticking then grease or brush the pan evenly with oil.Now lift the pan above the stovetop burner. Add 2 tablespoons of the batter at once in the pan. So use a spoon in which 2 tablespoons of the batter can fit in. You can also make larger sized wrappers using 3 to 4 tablespoons of the batter.Gently, spread the spoon clockwise to make a small thin crepe. Similar to the way we make dosa. Now keep the pan on the stovetop on a low heat. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water if the batter becomes thick while preparing the wrappers.Do remember that the crepes have to be thin. If they become thick, then they break while rolling and sealing.On a low heat cook the crepe (spring roll wrappers) till the sides start curling up and the crepe becomes kind of translucent.The crepe just need to be about cooked.

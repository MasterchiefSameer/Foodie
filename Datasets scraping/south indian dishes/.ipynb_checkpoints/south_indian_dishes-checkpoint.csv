Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours.Making batterBefore grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils and keep it for grinding urad dal. Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal. You can even use fresh water while grinding. Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula.Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. To make the batter, I added 1 cup water. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency. You can even grind to a smooth batter. Now pour the batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.Add ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt.Mix the salt very well with the batter. Also mix both the batters very well. Cover and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours. You can keep batter to ferment for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city.Preparation for potato fillingFirst rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker. You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender.When the potaoes are cooking, soak the chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain the chana dal and keep aside.When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the water from the potatoes and let them become warm. Then peel and chop them.Also slice the onions thinly and chop the green chilies, ginger and coriander leaves.Making potato fillingHeat oil or ghee in a frying pan or a skillet. Fry cashews and keep aside. This step of frying cashews is optional.Lower the flame and add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add the chana dal.Saute the chana dal for 2 to 3 minutes on a low flame or till they turn light golden or golden. Now add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger.Saute the onions stirring often till they soften and turn translucent.Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida (hing). Mix very well.Add water. Mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit.Next add the boiled chopped potatoes and mix very well. You can also mash the potatoes if you like while cooking them.Season with salt according to taste. Also add ¼ teaspoon sugar for a slight sweet taste.Simmer on a low flame for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally. The water will reduce and the consistency will thicken. Switch off the flame and then add chopped coriander leaves. Also add the fried cashews now and mix well. The potato filling should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato filling. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency.Stir and keep the potato filling aside.Making masala dosaLightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter and it would have increased in volume.Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don't smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won't be able to spread the batter.Keep the flame to a low, while spreading batter.Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan.On a medium flame, cook the dosa.Sprinkle some oil on top and edges. Cover with a lid and let it cook. You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon. Cook till its base becomes golden and crisp.When you see the base has become golden and the edges separate from the pan, place a portion of the potato filling on the dosa. You can spread it a bit if you want.Now fold the dosa and serve.Serving SuggestionsServe crisp restaurant style masala dosa hot with coconut chutney and sambar.Alternatively, simply make the dosa and serve the potato filling separately in a bowl.You can also choose to serve masala dosa with onion chutney, tomato chutney or peanut chutney.Storage and LeftoversThe batter stays good for 3 to 4 days in the fridge. You can opt to freeze the batter for a few weeks too. Store any leftover potato filling in the refrigerator for a day only.

Remove fried cashews with a slotted spoon draining the ghee and keep aside.To the same pan add mustard seeds and let them begin to splutter. Keep the heat to low or medium-low.When the mustard seeds begin to splutter add the chana dal.

Let the rava become warm.Making BatterTo the roasted rava, add finely grated carrots, chopped coriander leaves and ½ teaspoon salt or add as required.Next add curd (yogurt) and water as required. Depending on the quality of rava and the thickness of curd, you can adjust the water from ½ to ¾ cup.If the curd is liquid and has whey in it, then add ½ cup water. If the curd is very thick, then add ¾ cup water. Basically you need to get a medium consistency batter.Mix very well and let the batter rest covered for 20 minutes. The rava idli batter is neither thick nor thin in consistency and has a medium consistency.Brush oil or ghee on the idli pan moulds.

Heat the water till it comes to a boil.After 20 minutes this is the consistency of the batter after resting. If in case the batter looks thick, rava idli batter looks thick, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to get a medium consistency. Rava absorbs water and so the batter might thicken after 20 minutes. If the curd is thick, then also you may need to add more water. If you have added more water in the beginning, then you may not need to any water at this step. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon eno or ¼ teaspoon baking soda evenly over the batter. Quickly mix very well.Steaming Rava IdliPour the batter in the idli moulds. Place them in the pot with the hot water. Cover with a lid and steam rava idli for 10 to 12 minutes on medium heat.To check the doneness, a bamboo skewer or fork inserted in the rava idli should come out clean.

Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight.Grind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water.If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it. Add all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix well.Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.With your thumb make a hole in the center. You can also use banana leaves or ziplock bags to give the medu vada its donut shape.Making Medu VadaIn a kadai (wok) or pan heat oil for deep frying. Keep the heat to medium. Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil. Shape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don't overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. A very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then too the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil. Similarly fry remaining batches of medu vada with the batter.Any leftover batter can be refrigerated for about a day.

Also add crushed black pepper, cumin seeds, chopped curry leaves and salt as required.Add water. Depending on the quality of rava and rice flour, you can add less or more water – from 2 to 2.5 cups water. I added 2.25 cups water.Whisk till smooth without any lumps. The batter has to be flowing and thin. If the batter looks thick or has a medium consistency, then add more water. If the batter looks very thin and runny, then add some rice flour.Cover and let the suji dosa batter rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Once the batter rests, you will see that the rava and the flours have settled down and the water will be floating on top.Making rava dosaBefore preparing dosa, mix the batter very well. Spread some oil on the tawa. Do make sure that the tawa is hot.With a ladle pour the dosa batter. Start from the edges move towards the center.If there are big or small gaps, then fill them lightly with the batter.On a medium-low to medium flame, cook the suji ka dosa.When the top side looks cooked, then sprinkle ½ to 1 teaspoon oil on the top and sides.Spread oil all over the dosa with a spoon.Rava dosa takes a little longer time to cook than regular dosa.Cook till the base is golden and crisp. The edges will also separate from the pan.The more you cook the rava dosa and the more golden it becomes, the more crisp it will be. Flip and cook the second side for ½ to 1 minute. Fold and then serve suji ka dosa hot with coconut chutney and sambar. The flours settles down at the bottom of the batter. So you have to stir and mix the batter very well every time you make dosa. In case the batter becomes thick after making a few dosa, then add some water and stir again.Serve rava dosa with coconut chutney or dosa podi or any chutney of your choice. They also taste good with peanut chutney or tomato chutney or ginger chutney or onion chutney.For best taste and texture I recommend to serve these as soon as they are made.

Drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon of oil and spread it with the spoon. Before adding the oil, if using a cast iron pan, sprinkle some water to check the temperature of the pan. If the water droplets sizzle and evaporate, the pan is ready to make dosas.Avoid sprinkling water on a nonstick pan as adding water on a hot nonstick pan, may affect the nonstick layer coating.Stir the batter in the bowl and take a ladle full of batter and pour it from the circumference to the center. Do not spread the batter with the back of the ladle like the way we do for regular dosas. Fill the small or large gaps with a bit more of the batter.Sprinkle some oil around the sides and in the small holes or gaps and cook the dosa.Once the base becomes crisp and golden, flip and cook the other side.Once this side is cooked and crisp, flip again and you can cook the first side to make it more crisp. Fold on the tava and remove.Transfer to a plate and preferably serve oats dosa hot. if you are not able to serve hot, then just cover the prepared oats dosa with a lid and proceed to cook the remaining oats dosa in a similar way.The crisp texture changes if you serve the oats dosa warm or at room temperature. However, they still taste good.Serving SuggestionsServe these instant oats dosa with oats dosa tastes delicious with Coconut Chutney, Sambar, or Idli Podi.You can serve with Tomato Chutney, Onion Chutney, Peanut Chutney or Ginger Chutney.

As soon as you add eno, mix very well and be quick. Do mix the eno very well with the batter. Otherwise you will have a faint green color on the idlis as well as uneven texture in them.Pour the batter in the prepared idli moulds. Carefully place the idli stand in the pot or idli steamer or 5 litre pressure cooker or an electric cooker.When you place the idli stand in the pot or steamer, the water will be hot. So place it carefully.Cover with the lid of the pot or the Idli steamer. Steam the idlis for 10 to 12 minutes or till they are done and a tooth pick or fork inserted in the idlis, comes out clean. Note: If you have used a stovetop 5 litre pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid. Place the idli stand carefully in the cooker as the water will be hot. Then seal the lid (without the vent weight/whistle) tightly on to the cooker and steam the idlis on medium to medium-high heat for 10 to 12 minutes.These idlis cook faster. So do keep a check.

33,Roti Recipe | Chapati Recipe | Phulka Recipe (3 Ways),"Roti or Phulka or Chapati is an everyday staple Indian flatbread that is made in nearly every part of India. This roti or chapati recipe of an unleavened flatbread is made with basic ingredients – whole wheat flour, ghee, salt and water.",10minutes,30minutes,1hour,15,roti,Main Course,Indian,"Vegan, Vegetarian",▢ 3 cups whole wheat flour or atta – 360 grams▢ 1 to 1.25 cups water or add more if needed▢ 1 teaspoon salt – optional▢ 1 to 2 tablespoons oil  or ghee (clarified butter) – optional,"Kneading Roti DoughTake whole wheat flour (atta) in a bowl. Sift the flour with salt if you have flour which has a lot of bran. Add a bit of water, oil or ghee and start mixing.Adding water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough.Continue to knead the dough. Keep on adding water as required.Knead the dough till it becomes pliable, smooth and soft. The final dough consistency should not be very sticky or loose or hard.Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands to smoothen it.Flatten the ball. Sprinkle some whole wheat flour to the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour.Making PhulkaTurn on the gas stove and put the tawa to make it hot.While tawa is getting hot, start rolling the dough ball into a flat round circle.Once the tawa is sufficiently hot then put the roti on a hot tawa/griddle.First cook one side. It should be less than half cooked or about one-fourth cooked.Turn and cook the other side. This should be a little bit more cooked than the first side. Brown spots should be visible.Now hold the roti with a tong and keep the first side which was cooked, directly on fire. The roti will start to puff.Turn and keep the other side on fire. The roti will puff more. Avoid burning the rotis and also don’t overdo it as roti will not be soft and will become crisp and hard like papadums.Remove and apply ghee or oil on the phulka. Applying ghee or oil keep them soft for a long time. Phulka made with this method is ideally served hot.If you cannot serve them hot, then you can keep them in a container that keeps food warm like a casserole or in a roti basket. You can also wrap them up in a kitchen towel or napkin.Making Roti on TawaPlace the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Keep the heat to medium-high or high. Within some seconds you will see air pockets forming on the raw chapati doughRoast for about 30 seconds or so and you will see the air-pockets increase on the surface.Keep in mind that the timing will change or vary with the kind of skillet you are using, the chapati thickness and the intensity of the flame.Flip with spatula or tongs and roast the second side for about a minute. Flip again and you will see the second side cooked more than the first side with visible brown spots. With a clean folded cotton kitchen napkin or a spatula, begin to press the partially cooked roti on all sides and center. Pressing it evenly all over helps to puff up the roti. Keep on pressing all over, especially the flat portions, so that the entire roti gets puffed up well.If you prefer you can flip again and cook the second side too for some seconds if its looks under cooked. Transfer the soft and puffed roti in a roti-basket and spread some oil or ghee on top.Making ChapatiKeep the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook on medium-high to high heat for about 30 seconds or so until you see some air pockets all over. Flip the chapati and spread some oil all over while the second side is getting roasted. Cook the second side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.Flip again with a spatula. You will see that the second side is well roasted with some blisters and brown spots.Spread some oil on this cooked side. Roast the first side again for about 20 to 30 seconds.Remove and transfer to a chapati container or box. Keep covered. Make chapati with the rest of the dough in this manner.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe roti or phulka or chapati with any Indian meal. Accompany it with vegetable or paneer curries, stir-fried or sautéed vegetables (sabji) or lentils (dals). Store any leftover dough in an air-tight container for just about 1 to 2 days. If the dough has darkened or has a weird smell, then throw it away. Store the flatbreads in a roti box or in a covered container for a few hours. Always cover with a tight lid, so that the flatbreads remain soft. Brushing or spreading with some oil or ghee on the roti, keeps them softer.

So continue to cook and stir. The mixture will also start to leave the sides of the kadai or pan. While stirring also scrape the bottom of the kadai and the sides. If you do not scrape, then the mixture starts sticking and gets browned or burnt.So you have to stir nonstop and scrape. Do use a flat steel spatula (palta) as this helps in scraping the gram flour mixture.When the mixture comes together in one mass and you see some ghee at the sides, then also continue to stir and scrape.When you see many small bubbles and holes in the mixture, then switch off the heat.If you cook too much, then you will get a very hard mysore pak.Setting Mysore PakImmediately and quickly tilt the kadai and pour the whole mixture in the pan. It falls in one lot and you don’t need to use any spoon for it.Level with a spatula or the back of small glass or a small steel bowl.Let the mysore pak mixture become warm or cool down. If there is too much ghee at the sides or top, then invert the pan after 20 to 30 minutes, so that the excess ghee is removed. You can use this ghee while preparing dosa or greasing idli plates.Once warm or cooled, then just invert the pan on a chopping board or tray or plate. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan. The mysore pak block falls of easily. Then cut the mysore pak into rectangular or square pieces.Store in an air-tight container. It stays good for about a week to ten days at room temperature.Serve as a festive sweet to your family or friends.",NutritionCalories: 217kcal | Carbohydrates: 23g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 33mg | Sodium: 7mg | Potassium: 78mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 19g | Vitamin A: 4IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.04mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.01mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 0.2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.04mg | Vitamin E: 0.1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 6mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 37µg | Iron: 0.5mg | Magnesium: 15mg | Phosphorus: 27mg | Zinc: 0.2mg

Do not allow the rice to get browned.Then add milk which has been boiled before. The pre-boiled milk can be hot, warm or refrigerated.

Do stir when the milk is getting heated up, so that the bottom of the milk does not get scorched.After the milk has come to a boil, continue to simmer till the rice grains are cooked completely and softened.For quick cooking of the rice, I kept a lid on the pan. But in this case, you have to be in the kitchen so that you open the lid when the milk starts frothing up. Or else you can cook the rice uncovered.

After the rice grains are cooked, you can even mash them while stirring with a spoon or spatula.Once the rice grains are cooked well, add sugar.

Its color will also lighten.Add ¼ cup chilled fresh curd (dahi).Again with a spoon or spatula or a small wired whisk, mix and whip the curd with the creamed ghee.Cream till light and smooth.Making badusha doughNow using a sieve, take the all-purpose flour in it. Place it on the bowl itself. You can also sift the flour separately in a plate or tray.Add 1 pinch salt, 1 pinch baking soda and ½ teaspoon baking powder.Sift directly in the creamed ghee and curd.Mix the flour lightly with the creamed ghee and curd using  a spoon or spatula.Sprinkle some cold water in parts and begin to mix it. Overall you can use 8 to 9 tablespoons cold water. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water at a time and mix.Mix and combine everything to form a soft dough. Do not knead. Just mix and bring everything together to a dough. In case the dough becomes sticky, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Use light pressure from hands and form a dough. At this point, do not knead heavily or if required then knead very lightly.Cover the dough and keep aside for 15 minutes.Making sugar syrupMeanwhile make sugar syrup. While frying balushahi also you can make sugar syrup. Take 200 grams sugar or 1 heaped cup of sugar in a pan or bowl. Use a bowl or pan with more surface area so that the balushahi can get enough space for soaking.Add ½ cup water and mix.Place the pan on a low heat.Using a spoon stir the sugar so that it dissolves. If there are impurities in the sugar syrup, then add 1 tablespoon milk. Remove the scum that forms at the top.When all the sugar has dissolved, add ½ to 1 teaspoon green cardamom powder. Then add 10 to 12 saffron strands. Stir and mix again.Simmer the sugar solution on a low to medium-low heat. Do stir occasionally. To avoid crystallization of sugar, you can add some drops of lemon juice.Simmer till the syrup becomes sticky or you get ½ string consistency in the syrup. You can even cook it to 1 string consistency.The sugar syrup should be sticky. So cool syrup in a spoon and touch it and it should feels sticky. When the syrup becomes sticky, then switch off heat.Frying balushahiBefore frying balushahi you can begin to heat oil in a kadai or pan on a medium heat. You can also use ghee instead of oil to fry balushahi.Do use a kadai with handles at the sides. Pinch small to medium-sized balls from the dough. Roll them gently and lightly between your palms.Then make an indent or depression in them. You can flatten them slightly if you want. Make 5 to 6 badhusha depending on the size of kadai.Cover the remaining dough and keep aside. Check a tiny piece of the badhusha dough in the medium hot oil. It should come up gradually and steadily.Now lift the kadai from stove top and keep it on the kitchen table top. Gently begin to place balushahi in the hot oil.Be careful when you are keeping the balushahi in hot oil. Add 5 to 6 or 7 balushahi depending on the size of kadai. The badushah will expand in oil while frying, so make sure not to over crowd the kadai or pan.Now lift the kadai and place it again on a low heat.Begin to fry badusha on a low heat.When one side firms up and is light golden, turn over each badusha.Keep on turning them over at intervals and frying them on a low heat.Frying balushahi on a low flame takes about 12 to 15 minutes. This will depend on the size, thickness of kadai and the intensity of flame. It took me 14 minutes to fry each batch of 6 balushahi.Fry till golden and crisp.Using a slotted spoon remove them draining the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. When the first batch is getting fried, you can make balushahi from the dough and keep them ready to fry in the second round. Keep the shaped and prepared balushahi covered with a kitchen napkin. Then fry the second batch of balushahi in the same way.Making balushahiAfter a couple of minutes, when fried balushahi are still hot, place them in the hot or warm sugar syrup.With spoon or tongs turn over each badusha, so that both sides are coated with sugar syrup. Let these badusha soak in the sugar syrup for about 14 to 15 minutes.After 14 to 15 minutes, using tongs or spoon, lift each balushahi and place it in a serving tray or bowl. In the same sugar syrup, now add the second batch of balushahi.Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of pistachios all over. You can even sprinkle some saffron strand, rose petals and cardamom powder if you want. Press the pistachios, so that they stick to the sugar syrup on the badusha.Fry the remaining badusha and then soak them in the sugar syrup. In case if sugar syrup crystallizes then add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm or heat the syrup again on a low flame.Serve Balushahi as a sweet.

You can also use split husked urad dal instead of husked whole urad dal.Rinse both the urad dal and methi seeds for a couple of times with water.Soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.In another bowl take the parboiled rice or idli rice. Rinse the parboiled rice or idli rice for a couple of times and set aside.Add 2 cups of water. Mix well and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.Blending and Fermenting BatterStrain the urad dal and reserve the water. Keep this water for blending/grinding the dal.Add the strained urad dal in the grinder or blender.First add ¼ cup of the reserved water and blend for some seconds. Then add the rest of ¼ cup water and continue to blend until the batter is light, smooth and fluffy. If the mixer becomes too hot while blending, then stop for a few minutes. Let the mixer cool down and blend again.Quantity of water depends on the freshness of urad dal. So add water as required. Pour the urad dal batter in a large bowl or pan. The batter should be fluffy, smooth and light.To the same blender or grinder, add half of the rice.Then add ¼ to ½ cup water and blend till smooth. A fine grainy consistency of rice is also alright. You can blend the rice in two to three batches.Pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.Add 1 teaspoon rock salt or as per taste. In very cold temperatures, avoid adding salt. Instead add ¼ teaspoon sugar. Sugar aids in the fermentation process.Mix both the batters very well with a spoon or spatula.Cover and allow the batter to ferment overnight for 8 to 9 hours. The timing will vary depending on the temperature in your city.The batter should increase in volume and double or triple. It will also have a pleasant sour aroma and many tiny air pockets.Simply lightly stir the batter. Check the consistency. If the batter looks too thick, you can add about ⅛ to ¼ cup water or more if required. Mix well.Making UttapamHeat up a tawa or a cast iron pan, brush or spread some oil on the tawa. Pour the batter with a ladle or spoon. For nonstick pan, you need not grease the pan. The tawa has to be hot. While making uttapams, you can regulate the heat from low to high. Before pouring the batter, reduce the heat to low.Gently spread the batter to a thick pancake. Note that the quantity of batter to make uttapam will be more than what you would normally use for a dosa.

Use any regular rice. I used sona masuri rice.Then pressure cook the rice with 2 cups water, ¼ teaspoon salt for 3 to 4 whistles on a medium heat or for 11 to 12 minutes. You can also cook the rice in a pot.

These are also known as Murmura Laddu and Puri Unde.",5minutes,15minutes,20minutes,16,Murmura Ladoo,Desserts,Indian,Vegan,"▢ 3 cups puffed rice (pori, murmura) or 60 grams (I have used puffed rice murmura here and not puffed flattened rice)▢ ½ cup jaggery powder or grated jaggery – 120 grams jaggery powder▢ ¼ cup roasted gram (bhuna hua chana) or 25 grams roasted gram▢ ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder or 2 to 3 green cardamoms, crushed in mortar-pestle▢ 4 tablespoons water","PreparationFirst grate/powder the jaggery, powder the green cardamoms and keep them ready.Keep your pans ready. This will make the process super simple.I used one pot to melt the jaggery, strained the cleaned jaggery into another pot.You will need two separate pans – one to dry roast the murmura/puffed rice, another to heat the cleaned jaggery and making ladoos. Instead you can use the same pan to roast and later to heat jaggery. Keep a small bowl of water ready. This is for checking the thickness of the syrup.Making murmura laddu mixtureNow, on medium heat dry roast the murmura/ pori or puffed rice for 1 to 2 minutes, so that it crisps up. Keep this aside or transfer to another bowl.To a separate pot, add ½ cup of the grated/powdered jaggery and 4 tablespoons of water.Heat this until with constant stirring all the jaggery melts and gets mixed with the water. Turn off the heat.Now, pass the melted jaggery through a sieve to remove impurities. Collect the clean melted jaggery in another pot/container.Now, pour this clean jaggery mixture into a pan and heat on a low flame. Keep stirring the mixture.Add cardamom powder and continue to stir.After a couple of minutes, if you hold up the ladle with drops of the syrup falling back into the pan, the last drop should form a sort of string as it falls. Keep checking the thickness as the syrup heats.To ascertain the thickness of the syrup, add a couple of drops into a bowl of water. The droplets should not dissolve into the water.You should be able to pick up the drop which will form a soft to firm ball. This is the right consistency.Now, pour this prepared syrup into the murmura/puffed rice. Instead you can reduce the heat of the heated syrup pan and add murmura/puffed rice into the prepared syrup. If doing for the first time, I would suggest, pour the puffed rice into the jaggery syrup, mix, then make laddus.Add roasted gram, mix everything very well using a spatula.Making pori urundaiThe ladoo have to be prepared when the pori urundai mixture is still hot, otherwise the mixture will harden and making ladoo will be difficult.Wet your palms slightly with water, pick up a portion of the prepared mixture and form ladoo by pressing gently between your palms and giving it a spherical shape.Prepare ladoo with the rest of the mixture in the same manner.If towards the end the mixture becomes too hard, put the pan back on gentle heat for a few seconds. This will loosen the mixture allowing ladoo formation.Serve Pori Urundai as offering to the deities or serve as a sweet snack.",NutritionCalories: 46kcal | Carbohydrates: 10g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 0.1g | Saturated Fat: 0.003g | Sodium: 0.3mg | Potassium: 3mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 6g | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.05mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 0.002mg | Vitamin C: 0.01mg | Calcium: 7mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 0.5µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 1mg | Phosphorus: 3mg | Zinc: 0.03mg

Find the details below.Cooking in a pot or pan: Take the soaked rice and 2 cups of water in a pan. Cover and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until rice grains are tender and the water has been absorbed. If the most of the water has evaporated and the rice grains look undercooked, add a few tablespoons of hot water. Cover and continue to cook rice.Cooking in Instant Pot: Transfer the rice grains and 1.5 cups water in the Instant Pot. Seal the lid and position the valve to sealing. Pressure cook on high pressure for 4 to 5 minutes. When the cooking is complete and you hear the beep sound, wait for 5 minutes before giving a quick pressure release. Open the lid and transfer the rice to a tray or plate for cooling.When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and fluff the rice. For a softer texture in the rice, pressure cook for 3 whistlesTake the rice in a plate/tray and allow to cool grains completely. You can also cool the rice in the cooker itself. If there are lumps in the rice, then break the lumps once the rice is cooled.Making temperingHeat coconut oil in a pan. You can also use sesame oil or any other neutral oil. Reduce the heat to a low. Crackle mustard seeds first in the hot oil. Add the chana dal and urad dal. Stir and fry for about a minute.Then add chopped cashews.Stir and fry till the cashews turn golden.

You can also choose to drizzle some lemon juice on the rice while eating.You can serve coconut rice as is or pair with a gravy or curry like vegetable stew, potato roast, vegetable kurma, cauliflower kurma, potato curry or moong lentils curry or a simple dal and even plain homemade fresh curd or yogurt. I suggest pairing with gravy or curry for a really flavorful meal. Accompany some papadum (appalam) if you like.Since this rice has coconut, it is best had fresh. I do not recommend to store this rice in the fridge as the chances of coconut going rancid are very high. Moreover it is best to eat rice when freshly cooked.

Keep the heat to its lowest and add urad dal.Begin to roast urad dal and keep stirring often when roasting the lentils.Roast urad dal till they become aromatic or are light golden. Do not make them brown. Remove in a plate and let the roasted urad dal cool at room temperature.Take the roasted urad dal in a small dry grinder jar or a small chutney grinder jar. Grind to a fine flour. Keep aside.Meanwhile, spread oil on the murukku disc. Also spread some oil on the part of the murukku maker where the dough will be placed.Making murukku doughIn a fine sieve, take rice flour. Also add the urad dal flour to the same sieve.Next add red chilli powder, asafoetida powder and salt. Sift the dry ingredients twice.To the sifted flours add sesame seeds, carom seeds and ghee.Mix everything very well. Then with your fingertips mix the ghee in the flour evenly. The mixture should resemble breadcrumbs.Hold a small portion of the murukku mixture in your palms and it should hold itself together. It should not break or fall apart. If it breaks or falls apart, then add 1 to 2 teaspoons more of the ghee. Mix again very well and then check.Now add water in parts and begin to mix and knead.Keep on adding water in parts and knead very well.You will need about 10 to 11 tablespoons of water. The amount of water needed will depend on the quality of rice flour. Check the taste of dough and add more salt if required.Knead to a smooth and soft dough. Also keep the dough slightly moist, but do not make too moist or wet as then the murukku absorbs more oil.Murukku has to be made as soon as you knead the dough, so keep everything ready before you shape and fry them.Shaping murukkuNow divide the dough in two parts and add first part in murukku maker. Cover the second part of dough with a kitchen towel.Before you begin to shape the murukku, keep oil in a kadai (wok) or frying pan to get heated. Keep the oil on a low or medium-low heat, so that it does not become very hot. Use any neutral flavored oil with a high smoke point.Use butter paper or parchment paper squares. Cut them in squares and keep ready before you make murukku. Press the murukku maker and move in rounds to get the concentric circles or spiral shape on the paper squares. Break the dough towards the end and press it to the last concentric circle of the spiral.Tip 1 – If the murukku breaks while forming them, this means that the dough does not have enough moisture. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water and knead the dough again.Tip 2 – If you are not getting proper shape, this mean that the dough is too moist. Add some rice flour and knead again.Make a batch of murukku. E.g make 3 to 5 murukku that you will be frying at a time.Frying murukkuNext test the hotness of the oil. Add a small piece of the murukku dough in the oil and it should come up gradually. If it comes up fast, the oil is hot, so reduce the heat. If it sticks or is at the bottom or comes up slowly, the oil is not hot enough, so increase the heat.Take the butter paper with the murukku in your hands. Then take a small to medium sized wooden spatula and place it on the murukku gently.Then gently turn over the spatula. The butter paper will be facing you. Lift the butter paper gently.The murukku will be neatly placed on the wooden spatula.Now gently tilt or place the spatula in oil, so that the murukku slides in the oil.Add the remaining murukku also in this manner. Fry on a medium heat.When they turn light golden, then flip them gently. Fry the second side. Fry the murukku till the oil stops sizzling or till they become crisp and golden. Do not brown them too much. Turn over as needed for even frying.Tip 3 – Check the first batch of murukku. If it looks like that the murukku has absorbed oil or breaks in oil, then add some rice flour, about 1 to 2 tablespoons and knead again. This happens if too much fat has gone in the dough.Remove with a slotted spoon draining extra oil in the kadai or pan itself.Place them on kitchen paper towels to soak extra oil.Once they cool at room temperature, then store murukku in an air-tight box at room temperature.Serve Murukku as a tea-time snack.",NutritionCalories: 49kcal | Carbohydrates: 5g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 3g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 2mg | Sodium: 37mg | Potassium: 5mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 2mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 2mg | Phosphorus: 5mg | Zinc: 1mg

Let it melt.When the ghee melts, add cashews. On a low heat fry the cashews until they become golden.Remove the golden fried cashews with a slotted spoon and then the raisins.Fry the raisins on a low heat. The raisins will soon start to swell up. Stir often while frying.Once the raisins swell, then remove them with a slotted spoon.Set the raisins aside with the fried cashews.Roasting semiya (stove-top method)In the same kadai add the broken semiya (seviyan or vermicelli).Mix well. Keep the flame to a low and begin to roast the semiya stirring often.Roast until the semiya becomes golden. Stir often while roasting semiya for even browning.Making semiya payasam (stove-top method)When the semiya has turned golden, add 3.5 cups milk. Milk can be chilled, warm, hot or at room temperature. For a thin payasam, add 4 cups milk. Do note that on cooling the payasam thickens. So add milk accordingly.Mix very well.Keep the heat to a low or medium-low and simmer until the semiya softens and are cooked well.Do stir at intervals so that the milk or semiya does not stick or get burnt at the bottom of the pan or kadai.Simmer until the vermicelli strands are softened nicely.Then add sugar.

Instant pot methodPress the sauté button of your IP. When you see the ""hot"" display on the screen, add ghee. Let it melt. Add the cashews and stirring often fry them until golden. Remove and set aside. Tip in the raisins and fry them until they swell. Remove and set aside.Add the vermicelli. Stirring non-stop roast them until golden. If the heat becomes too much, then press the sauté button to get the ""less"" option.Add milk and sugar. Give a good stir. Close the lid and position the pressure valve to sealing position. Press the porridge button and set the time to 7 minutes on high pressure. When the cooking is done (after you hear the Instant pot beep), give a quick pressure release after 10 minutes.Open the lid carefully. Add the cardamom powder and the fried cashews and raisins. Mix and stir. If the consistency is thin for your liking, then using the sauté function, simmer for a couple of minutes until the consistency thickens a bit. Serving SuggestionsSemiya payasam can be served hot, warm or chilled. When it comes to a room temperature, then you can refrigerate and serve later if you prefer that.On cooling and refrigerating payasam will thicken. So keep it to a slight flowing consistency when you want to serve it cold, so that it does not thicken too much. If at all the payasam has thickened too much, then simply add a bit of milk to thin the consistency.StorageIf there any leftovers, then refrigerate for 3 to 4 days in a covered container. I would not recommend freezing as the taste and texture changes and becomes way off. After refrigeration, you can reheat the payasam on low heat if you want to eat it hot or warm. Add some milk or water if the consistency has thickened too much.

You can use a spatula with a wooden handle/base or the bottom of a wooden spatula. I used a wooden spatula.Measure 1 cup of ragi flour. Remove 2 teaspoons of the ragi flour and set aside.Add to 2 cups water in a sauce pan or pot. Add the 2 teaspoons ragi flour to the water and mix well.Add salt and mix again. Note that traditionally salt and ghee are not added, but I like to add some salt. Boil Ragi SlurryPlace the thick bottomed pan containing the slurry on the stove over medium heat.Stir occasionally. Let this slurry come to a boil. Make Ragi DoughWhen the slurry begins to boil, lower the heat and sprinkle the remaining ragi flour evenly all over the pan. Ensure that the ragi flour is evenly distributed across the top of the liquid. Do not mix or stir. Let it cook undisturbed for 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat.After this undisturbed cooking period, mix very thoroughly with the wooden stick.Ensure that there are no dry flour specks or lumps visible. Incorporate any visible dry flour into the the wet mixture by continuing to stir. The mixture will thicken and become sticky. NOTE: 2 cups of water works perfect for me. But if the dough mixture looks dry, add in a few tablespoons of hot water. If it is too moist, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of ragi flour. Keep on mixing for a few minutes and you will see the mixture clumping together and gathering around itself.Steam DoughScrape any remaining dough off the wooden stick and return to the pan. Cover and steam for 6 to 7 minutes on low heat.When the steaming is complete, turn off the stove and remove the pan from heat.  Allow it to remain covered and continue to steam for 5 minutes.When you take a tiny portion of the dough and shape into a ball, it should easily form a ball without sticking to your fingers.Knead and Shape Ragi MuddeBrush or spread some water on a plate. Transfer the cooked ragi mudde mixture onto the plate using the stick. Remove the small lump at the bottom of the pan.

253,Mixture Recipe | Madras Mixture,"One of the popular South Indian snacks made during Diwali is this Madras Mixture Recipe which is basically a mix of various edible ingredients, nuts and dry fruits. It is also called as Omapodi Mixture.",15minutes,1hour,1hour,350,grams,Snacks,"South Indian, Tamil Nadu",Vegetarian,"For omapodi▢ 1  teaspoon  carom seeds (ajwain, omam)▢ 1  cup gram flour (besan) – 120 grams▢ ½  cup  Rice Flour or 100 grams▢ 1  generous pinch asafoetida (hing)▢ 2  pinches turmeric powder – optional▢ ¼  teaspoon  Red Chilli Powder▢ 1  teaspoon  salt  or add as required▢ 1  tablespoon  oil  or ghee or butter▢ 6 to 7  tablespoons  water  or add as required▢ oil  as required for deep frying","Making omapodiPreparing omapodi doughHeat a small pan and keep flame to a low. Add 1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds).Stirring often roast ajwain for some seconds till they are aromatic. No need to brown them. Let them cool down.Then add them in a small dry grinder jar or a spice grinder.Grind to a fine powder. Keep aside. You can even crush ajwain in a mortar-pestle. In this case, when adding ajwain, use a tea strainer and sift the ajwain powder through it. This is done so that when pressing through the sev maker, the dough strands do not break.In a mixing bowl or pan take 1 cup besan (gram flour) and ½ cup rice flour.Add the ground ajwain powder.Then add 1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing), 2 pinches turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder and 1 teaspoon salt. You can add salt as per taste. Turmeric powder can be skipped. For a spicy omapodi, you can increase the amount of red chilli powder. For more crispiness you can add a pinch of baking soda also.Mix very well with a spoon or spatula.Now heat 1 tablespoon oil in a steel bowl or a steel measuring cup.When the oil becomes hot, add it to the flour mixture. Instead of oil you can also use ghee or butter.Now add water in parts. First add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water. Mix well and begin to knead to a smooth dough. Overall I used 7 tablespoons of water. You can add 6 to 7 tablespoons of water depending on the quality of besan and rice flour.Knead to a smooth dough. If the dough becomes sticky, then you can add some more besan. If the dough looks dry, then add some more water and knead again. Cover the bowl and set aside.Use the disc to make sev or omapodi and assemble the sev press or murukku press. You can even use the disc with fine holes. Also heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying omapodi.Apply some water or oil in the sev/murukku maker. Then take a portion of the omapodi dough and place it inside the sev maker. Cover with the top part and keep aside.Frying omapodiLet the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small tiny piece of the omapodi dough. If the small piece of dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough for frying.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the sev maker on top of the oil and let the sev directly fall in the oil. While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a chakli. Do not over crowd the kadai with omapodi. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai. Be careful when pressing the dough in the oil. After the omapodi is pressed in the oil, break the top strands with a spoon or knife and let the dough strands fall in the oil.After adding the omapodi, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first for a minute. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.Gently begin to turn with a slotted spoon.Now fry the second side. You can turn over a couple of times for even frying.When the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry for some more seconds till the omapodi are golden and crisp. Turn over as needed when frying. Do not break the omapodi while frying as then it becomes extra work to remove the small pieces of omapodi from the oil. So fry the entire round shaped omapodi as one piece and do not break it.Once done then remove omapodi with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon draining off the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining omapodi in the same way.When the omapodi are cooled, then place them in an air tight container or box. Break omapodi before adding in the mixture. Making BoondiPreparing boondi batterTake ½ cup besan (gram flour) and 1 tablespoon rice flour in a mixing bowl.Then add 1 pinch asafoetida (hing), 1 pinch of baking soda, 2 pinches turmeric powder and ½ teaspoon salt.Mix everything with a spoon.Now add 8 to 9 tablespoons water in parts.Using a wired whisk make a smooth and slightly thin batter without lumps.The batter consistency is slightly thin. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of gram flour. So add accordingly.frying boondiHeat oil for frying in a kadai or pan. When the oil becomes hot, then tap the wired whisk or the handle of a spoon which has a bit of batter in to the hot oil.Now take a dry perforated ladle/jhara and place it above the hot oil. Don't keep too much on a height, as the batter droplets, when falling from a height, do not give a round shape. With a spoon add some batter on the perforated spoon ladle/jhara. Spread the batter lightly with a spoon. Finish up the batter on the perforated spoon ladle this way.On a medium flame heat to fry the boondi. Do not turn them. Let them become slightly crisp and then turn them.When the boondi have become crisp, turn them with a slotted spoon.After the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry the boondi for some more seconds so that they become crisp.Remove with a strainer spoon or a slotted spoon draining the extra oil.Place the fried salted boondi on kitchen paper towels.After each batch, wipe the perforated ladle/jhara with a clean piece of moist thin cotton kitchen towel from both sides. Continue to fry boondi this way. Once the boondi cools at room temparature, store in an air tight jar or box.When the boondi are frying you can remove the other ingredients and keep everything ready for the next step.Frying nutsUse a fine sieve ladle with a handle to fry as shown in the stepwise photos in the post. Heat oil on medium heat. Take the peanuts first in the sieve. Immerse in the oil and begin to fry.With a spoon stir often while frying so that the peanuts are fried evenly.Fry peanuts till they are crisp and crunchy.Using the same seive drain the extra oil. So this ladle is helpful for frying as well as for getting rid of extra oil after frying.Place the fried peanuts on kitchen paper towel.Then take cashews in the same ladle.Stirring often with a spoon fry cashews till they are golden.Place the fried cashews on the same kitchen paper towel.Next take roasted chana dal.Stirring often with a spoon fry roasted chana dal till they are crisp.Frying chana dal will take some seconds and their color will change.Place the fried chana dal on the same kitchen paper towel.Now take thick poha.Stirring often with a spoon fry poha till they are crisp and pale golden. Don't brown the poha.Once the poha is fried well, then drain off the extra oil using the same ladle.Place the fried poha on the same kitchen paper towel.Next add curry leaves. stirring often fry curry leaves till they become crisp.Curry leaves take a few seconds to fry. Place the fried curry leaves on the kitchen paper towel.Making Madras MixtureIn a large bowl or tray or plate take 2 cups of the omapodi and 2 cups of fried boondi. The remaining omapodi you can serve as a snack. With the remaining boondi, you can make boondi raita. You can also take more of the omapodi or boondi if you prefer.Add the fried nuts, poha, chana dal, curry leaves.Add ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, ⅛ teaspoon asafoetida (hing) and salt over the fried chana dal, poha, nuts and curry leaves as they will be still hot.Mix well with a spoon first and then later you can mix with your hands.Then place the mixture in a jar or container.

My vegan Soya Chunks Curry recipe is made with textured vegetable protein in a rich and deeply spiced tomato onion coconut flavored gravy for a meatless gluten-free meal that everyone will love.",15minutes,25minutes,40minutes,4,,Main Course,"Indian, South Indian","Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian",Prepping soya chunks▢ 1 cup soya chunks – 50 grams▢ 3 cups water▢ 1 pinch salt – optional,"Prepping Soya ChunksRinse the chunks 2 to 3 times in water and drain all the water. Add 3 cups water and pinch of salt to a pan. Add soya chunks. Boil for 5 minutes. This means that after the water starts to boil, continue to boil for a total of 5 minutes on medium heat. Drain the water. Rinse very well with fresh water. Press and squeeze the chunks to remove all the extra water the chunks have absorbed. Set aside. Sautéing Onions, Tomatoes, Herbs Heat 3 tablespoons neutral oil in a pan. Keep heat to medium-low or medium. Add 1 cup finely chopped onions and begin to sauté in the oil on medium-low to medium heat. Continue to sauté until onions start to caramelize and turn golden. Reduce heat to low. Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste to the pan with your caramelized onions.Mix and sauté for few seconds on a low heat until the raw aroma is gone.Add ½ cup finely chopped tomatoes. Sauté on low to medium-low heat until tomatoes soften and become pulpy. Let oil release from the sides.Add ground spices and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes on low heat. Assemble and Cook CurryAdd soya chunks with 2 tablespoons chopped coriander and 1 tablespoon chopped mint leaves.Mix well and season with salt.Add 1 cup water.Mix well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.TIP: If you do not have coconut milk, you can stop here and serve the soya chunks curry. The gravy here will have a medium to medium-thick consistency. If the gravy looks very thick, simply add a bit more water. Be careful not to add too much, as this will dilute the flavors. Optional – Add Coconut MilkIf including coconut milk, first switch off heat and then add 1 cup coconut milk. Mix very well. Put on the heat and simmer on low until the gravy is hot and then switch off heat. Do not boil as the heat can curdle the coconut milk.Optional – Temper Curry Leaves and ChilesIf you use coconut milk, I recommend following this step. Tempering the curry leaves and green chillies adds a lot of flavor to the curry gravy. If you are not using coconut milk, you can skip this step. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan. Whichever oil you have used earlier, use the same oil at this step.Add 1 or 2 sliced green chillies (depending on your heat preference) and fry them for a few seconds. Add 12 to 15 curry leaves (chopped or kept whole).Stirring well, fry for a few seconds until curry leaves are crisp. Add the tempered spices and oil to the prepared meal maker curry. Mix well.Serving SuggestionsServe meal maker curry hot or very warm with Roti or Paratha for dipping, or enjoy with simple Steamed Basmati Rice, Jeera Rice or Ghee Rice if you are gluten-free. Garnish the curry with coriander leaves or mint leaves. You can also serve this soya vadi curry as a side gravy with Vegetable Biryani or Pulao.Storage and LeftoversStore any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to one day only. Since coconut milk is used in the recipe, the gravy can curdle and go rancid if left for too long. To reheat, use a small saucepan. Add a bit of water if the curry has become thick.

281,Omapodi Recipe (Karapusa),Omapodi or Karapusa is a delicious and crispy South Indian snack of sev laced with the aroma and flavor of ajwain or carom seeds.,10minutes,20minutes,30minutes,300,grams,Snacks,South Indian,Vegan,"▢ 1  teaspoon  carom seeds (omam, ajwain)▢ 1  cup  gram flour  (besan) – 120 grams▢ ½  cup  Rice Flour – 100 grams▢ 1  generous pinch asafoetida (hing)▢ 2  pinches turmeric powder – optional▢ ¼ to ½  teaspoon  Red Chilli Powder or add as needed▢ 1 teaspoon  salt  or add as required▢ 1  tablespoon  oil  or ghee or butter▢ 6 to 7  tablespoons  water  or add as required▢ oil as required for deep frying","PreparationHeat a small pan and keep the heat to a low. Add 1 teaspoon carom seeds.Stirring often roast carom seeds for some seconds till they are aromatic. No need to brown them. Set aside and let them cool.When cooled, add them in a small dry grinder jar or a spice grinder.Grind to a fine powder. Set aside.Making omapodi doughIn a mixing bowl or pan take gram flour and rice flour.Add the ground carom seeds powder.Then add asafoetida (hing), turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt. You can add salt as per taste. Turmeric powder can be omitted. For a spicier omapodi, you can increase the quantity of red chilli powder.Mix very well with a spoon or spatula. Next heat 1 tablespoon oil in a steel bowl or a steel measuring cup.When the oil becomes hot, add it to the flour mixture. Instead of oil you can also use ghee or butter.Mix oil with the flour mixture with a spoon or spatula.Next add water in portions. First add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water. Mix well and begin to knead to a smooth dough. Overall I added 7 tablespoons of water. You can add 6 to 7 tablespoons of water depending on the quality of gram flour and rice flour.Knead to a smooth dough. If the omapodi dough becomes sticky, then you can add some more besan. If the dough looks dry, then add some more water and knead again. Cover the bowl.Frying omapodiFrom the sev press or murukku press, take the disc that is used to make omapodi. You can even use the disc with fine holes. Heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying omapodi.Apply some water or oil in the sev press or murukku maker. Then take a portion of the omapodi dough and place it inside the sev maker. Cover with the top part and keep aside.Let the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small tiny piece of the omapodi dough. If the small piece of dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough for frying omapodi.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the sev maker on top of the oil and let the dough strands directly fall in the oil. While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a chakli. Do not over crowd the kadai with the dough strands. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai. Be careful when pressing the sev in the oil.After the dough strands are pressed in the oil, break the top sev strands with a spoon or knife and let the dough strands fall in the oil.After adding the dough strands in the oil, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first for a minute. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.Gently begin to turn with a slotted spoon. Now fry the second side.You can turn over a couple of times for even frying.When the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry for some more seconds till the omapodi are golden and crisp. Turn over as needed when frying.Once done then remove with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon draining off the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining omapodi in the same way in batches.When they are cooled, then place them in an air tight container or box.Serve omapodi as a diwali snack or a tea time snack.",NutritionCalories: 352kcal | Carbohydrates: 41g | Protein: 9g | Fat: 17g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 800mg | Potassium: 296mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 50IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 6mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 1mg | Iron: 9mg | Magnesium: 9mg | Phosphorus: 26mg | Zinc: 1mg

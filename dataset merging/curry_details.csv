Set aside. This will be the sweet-tangy and crunchy stuffing for the kofta.Make medium sized balls from the kofta mixture. If it feels sticky, rub some oil on your palms before shaping the kofta.Flatten one kofta ball lightly with your palms on a chopping board or a rolling board. Place a small portion of the cashews and raisins stuffing on it. Gently bringing the edges together, shape into a neat ball. Rub some oil in your palms while shaping.

Lastly add the crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and cream.Mix well and set the gravy aside. Check the taste and add more salt or sugar if needed.Frying paneer koftaHeat oil in a frying pan or a wok (kadai). Before shaping and frying the entire batch, check a small tiny piece of the paneer kofta in hot oil. If it does not break, then you can easily fry the remaining koftas. If it does break, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of cornflour (cornstarch) as a binder. Mix the binder in well, then shape into koftas.The kofta should also come up swiftly yet gradually in the hot oil. This means the oil is hot enough for the kofta to be fried. If it browns too quickly, the oil is very hot and if the kofta remains at the bottom, the oil is warm. Carefully add the paneer kofta to the hot oil, being careful not to spatter the oil. The oil should be medium hot and have a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees Celsius (356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).When one side becomes golden, gently turn over with a slotted spoon and fry the second side. Fry turning over a couple of times until golden on both sides.Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate.

Place the kofta neatly on the gravy. Drizzle some cream or top with grated paneer. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves or mint leaves and serve. If serving a few hours later, reheat the gravy until hot. If it looks very thick, add a bit of hot water. Warm the kofta in an oven at 120 degrees Celsius or 250 degrees Fahrenheit for some minutes. Place kofta on the gravy. Add the garnishes and serve.Note that these paneer kofta are really soft. So if you add them to the gravy and serve them later, they will break. You have to serve them immediately as soon as you add them to the gravy.

Then soak the chickpeas in enough water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.Drain the water. Rinse the chickpeas again in fresh water and then add them to a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker.Add whole spices – cinnamon, black cardamom, tej patta and cloves. I have also added dried amla to get the dark color in the chickpeas. Instead of dried amla, you can add 1 black tea bag. You can also simply cook the chickpeas plain with the spices and water.Pour the 2.5 cups of water.Pressure cook the chickpeas for 15 minutes on medium to medium-high heat. Wait for the pressure to drop naturally in the cooker. Then open the lid and check if the chickpeas are cooked well. The chickpeas must be tender, softened and have a melt in the mouth texture. They should mash easily when you press with a spoon. The cooked chickpeas must not give you any slight bite when you eat them.If you do not have a pressure cooker, then cook the chickpeas in a pot with plenty of water or in an Instant Pot. Cooking chickpeas in a pot will take a lot of time though.Remove the amla pieces which would have softened by now or the tea bag from the stock. You can also remove the whole spices from the stock, but I keep them. Keep the cooked chickpeas along with the stock aside.Making chana masalaHeat oil in a kadai (wok) or a pan. Add slit whole green chilies and fry them on medium-low heat until the have some light golden blisters on them.Ensure to slit the green chilies and fry, so that they do not burst in the oil. Note that you could skip frying the green chillies if you prefer. Or opt to add 1 to 2 green chilies in the masala while sautéing. Place the fried green chilies on kitchen paper towels for any excess oil to be drained.In the same oil, add the carom seeds. Sauté for a few seconds until the carom seeds are fragrant.Add finely chopped onions. Stir and sauté until the onions turn translucent or light brown.Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Sauté until their raw aroma goes away.Add turmeric powder, red chili powder and garam masala powder. Mix the spice powders with the sautéed onions and then add finely chopped tomatoes. Stir the whole mixture very well to combine the tomatoes with the mixture. Sauté until the tomatoes soften and the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala.When the oil starts separating from the onion and tomato masala and it looks glossy, at this point add the chickpeas along with the stock (the water in which the chickpeas were cooked).You could also opt to add fresh water instead of the stock.Mix well and then add salt and dry mango powder.Stir again and simmer the curry on medium-low to medium heat. You can also mash a few chickpeas with the back of the spoon to thicken the gravy.Simmer till the gravy has thickened. You will also see some oil specks floating at the top of the gravy.Check the taste and add more salt, red chili powder, garam masala powder or dry mango powder if needed.Lastly add the fried green chilies to the gravy or keep them aside to be used as a garnish. Serve Chana Masala hot garnished with coriander leaves paired with bhatura or pooris or naan or roti.As a side accompaniment serve the Chana Masala with sliced onions, tomatoes and lime or lemon. You can also add some fried potato cubes as a topping and serve.

Add 3 cups water and pinch of salt to a pan. Add soya chunks. Boil for 5 minutes. This means that after the water starts to boil, continue to boil for a total of 5 minutes on medium heat. Drain the water. Rinse very well with fresh water. Press and squeeze the chunks to remove all the extra water the chunks have absorbed. Set aside. Sautéing Onions, Tomatoes, Herbs Heat 3 tablespoons neutral oil in a pan. Keep heat to medium-low or medium. Add 1 cup finely chopped onions and begin to sauté in the oil on medium-low to medium heat. Continue to sauté until onions start to caramelize and turn golden. Reduce heat to low. Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste to the pan with your caramelized onions.Mix and sauté for few seconds on a low heat until the raw aroma is gone.Add ½ cup finely chopped tomatoes. Sauté on low to medium-low heat until tomatoes soften and become pulpy. Let oil release from the sides.Add ground spices and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes on low heat. Assemble and Cook CurryAdd soya chunks with 2 tablespoons chopped coriander and 1 tablespoon chopped mint leaves.Mix well and season with salt.Add 1 cup water.Mix well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.TIP: If you do not have coconut milk, you can stop here and serve the soya chunks curry. The gravy here will have a medium to medium-thick consistency. If the gravy looks very thick, simply add a bit more water. Be careful not to add too much, as this will dilute the flavors. Optional – Add Coconut MilkIf including coconut milk, first switch off heat and then add 1 cup coconut milk. Mix very well. Put on the heat and simmer on low until the gravy is hot and then switch off heat. Do not boil as the heat can curdle the coconut milk.Optional – Temper Curry Leaves and ChilesIf you use coconut milk, I recommend following this step. Tempering the curry leaves and green chillies adds a lot of flavor to the curry gravy. If you are not using coconut milk, you can skip this step. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan. Whichever oil you have used earlier, use the same oil at this step.Add 1 or 2 sliced green chillies (depending on your heat preference) and fry them for a few seconds. Add 12 to 15 curry leaves (chopped or kept whole).Stirring well, fry for a few seconds until curry leaves are crisp. Add the tempered spices and oil to the prepared meal maker curry. Mix well.Serving SuggestionsServe meal maker curry hot or very warm with Roti or Paratha for dipping, or enjoy with simple Steamed Basmati Rice, Jeera Rice or Ghee Rice if you are gluten-free. Garnish the curry with coriander leaves or mint leaves. You can also serve this soya vadi curry as a side gravy with Vegetable Biryani or Pulao.Storage and LeftoversStore any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to one day only. Since coconut milk is used in the recipe, the gravy can curdle and go rancid if left for too long. To reheat, use a small saucepan. Add a bit of water if the curry has become thick.

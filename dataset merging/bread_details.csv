Add ½ cup water in parts and knead to a supple, soft and smooth dough.Cover with a clean kitchen towel cloth and keep the dough to leaven for 45 minutes to 1 hour until doubled.  Note that the time taken to leaven will depend on the room temperature.Once the dough is leavened, portion it in equal sized balls. Roll the portioned dough between your palms and make a neat ball. Flatten it lightly.Place the balls on a tray with some space next to them. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.Making garlic butterMeanwhile melt butter completely in a small pan or skillet.Add garlic and turn off the heat. The garlic will be cooked with the heat from the melted butter and you won’t get the raw pungent garlic flavor in the naan bread.When this melted butter mixture become warm, add the chopped mint or coriander leaves. Set aside. Assembling and Rolling Sprinkle flour on the dough and place it on a lightly dusted rolling board. Avoid adding too much of the flour when rolling. Use sparingly and as needed.Sprinkle nigella seeds or sesame seeds on the dough. With a rolling pin make a round or oval shape dough. You could pull the top part of the rolled dough with your fingers to make a tapering dough. Turn over gently the rolled dough and let the side with the nigella seeds touch the rolling board's surface. Spread water all over on the top side.Making Garlic NaanNext heat a tawa or a flat skillet. Keep the heat to medium-high or high.Place the watered side touching the hot skillet or tawa.Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until you see the base getting nicely browned and charred.Using a spatula separate the naan from the skillet. Lift the naan with tongs and place it on direct flame with the side that is not cooked touching the flame.Move the naan all over the flame to ensure the sides and the surfaces are well cooked with some chars. If you see that the side which was cooked earlier on the skillet, looks raw, then cook this side too on the flame. Place on a tray or plate and brush the garlic butter spreading some garlic and mint/cilantro (from the garlic butter) all over on the naan. You can either use a roti basket to store the naans or use a clean cotton kitchen towel to stack the naans. When placing them, place the buttered side facing each other for two naans, so that the butter does not touch your kitchen towel. Make the naans one by one this way.Serve Garlic Naan Bread hot or warm. Garnish with some cilantro or mint if you like.",NutritionCalories: 195kcal | Carbohydrates: 24g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 10g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Trans Fat: 0.2g | Cholesterol: 15mg | Sodium: 148mg | Potassium: 85mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 177IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.3mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin B12: 0.01µg | Vitamin C: 0.4mg | Vitamin D: 0.1µg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 12mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 53µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 25mg | Phosphorus: 79mg | Zinc: 1mg

Sift the flour with salt if you have flour which has a lot of bran. Add a bit of water, oil or ghee and start mixing.Adding water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough.Continue to knead the dough. Keep on adding water as required.Knead the dough till it becomes pliable, smooth and soft. The final dough consistency should not be very sticky or loose or hard.Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands to smoothen it.Flatten the ball. Sprinkle some whole wheat flour to the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour.Making PhulkaTurn on the gas stove and put the tawa to make it hot.While tawa is getting hot, start rolling the dough ball into a flat round circle.Once the tawa is sufficiently hot then put the roti on a hot tawa/griddle.First cook one side. It should be less than half cooked or about one-fourth cooked.Turn and cook the other side. This should be a little bit more cooked than the first side. Brown spots should be visible.Now hold the roti with a tong and keep the first side which was cooked, directly on fire. The roti will start to puff.Turn and keep the other side on fire. The roti will puff more. Avoid burning the rotis and also don’t overdo it as roti will not be soft and will become crisp and hard like papadums.Remove and apply ghee or oil on the phulka. Applying ghee or oil keep them soft for a long time. Phulka made with this method is ideally served hot.If you cannot serve them hot, then you can keep them in a container that keeps food warm like a casserole or in a roti basket. You can also wrap them up in a kitchen towel or napkin.Making Roti on TawaPlace the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Keep the heat to medium-high or high. Within some seconds you will see air pockets forming on the raw chapati doughRoast for about 30 seconds or so and you will see the air-pockets increase on the surface.Keep in mind that the timing will change or vary with the kind of skillet you are using, the chapati thickness and the intensity of the flame.Flip with spatula or tongs and roast the second side for about a minute. Flip again and you will see the second side cooked more than the first side with visible brown spots. With a clean folded cotton kitchen napkin or a spatula, begin to press the partially cooked roti on all sides and center. Pressing it evenly all over helps to puff up the roti. Keep on pressing all over, especially the flat portions, so that the entire roti gets puffed up well.If you prefer you can flip again and cook the second side too for some seconds if its looks under cooked. Transfer the soft and puffed roti in a roti-basket and spread some oil or ghee on top.Making ChapatiKeep the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook on medium-high to high heat for about 30 seconds or so until you see some air pockets all over. Flip the chapati and spread some oil all over while the second side is getting roasted. Cook the second side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.Flip again with a spatula. You will see that the second side is well roasted with some blisters and brown spots.Spread some oil on this cooked side. Roast the first side again for about 20 to 30 seconds.Remove and transfer to a chapati container or box. Keep covered. Make chapati with the rest of the dough in this manner.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe roti or phulka or chapati with any Indian meal. Accompany it with vegetable or paneer curries, stir-fried or sautéed vegetables (sabji) or lentils (dals). Store any leftover dough in an air-tight container for just about 1 to 2 days. If the dough has darkened or has a weird smell, then throw it away. Store the flatbreads in a roti box or in a covered container for a few hours. Always cover with a tight lid, so that the flatbreads remain soft. Brushing or spreading with some oil or ghee on the roti, keeps them softer.

If the mixture looks dry or floury, then add 1 tablespoon curd again and knead. The quantity of curd required depends on the type and quality of flour. I used 2 tablespoons of curd to knead the dough.Knead into a smooth dough. The dough is slightly sticky. So while kneading you can apply some oil/ghee in your hands and knead.If the dough becomes very sticky, then add some whole wheat flour and sugar accordingly.Keep the dough covered in a bowl for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or refrigerate the dough overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.

Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly with a spoon. Add lukewarm water in portions and begin to knead the dough.Knead the dough for 12 to 15 minutes or until soft, smooth, supple and elastic adding water as needed.Cover with a moist cotton napkin and set aside to rest for 45 minutes to 1 hour. You can also let the dough rest for 30 minutes if short of time. Next portion dough into 8 equal sized parts by first making a log of the dough and then cutting it into equal pieces. Roll each portioned dough between your palms and shape to round balls.Place the dough falls in the same bowl keeping some space between each of them.Pour 3 tablespoons oil all over the dough balls. Lift each dough ball and coat it evenly with the oil.Cover with a napkin or lid and rest the oil coated dough balls for 20 to 30 minutes. You could let them rest for an hour also. Making Layers – Method 1With a rolling pin, roll to about 12 inches circle or 12 by 9 inches rectangle having a thin layer. If you have the skill, you can even flatten the dough with fingers instead of rolling it with a rolling pin.Cut the rolled layer of dough to 0.5 or 1 cm strips vertically. Bring the cut strips gently together in one lot. Place these long cut strips of dough collected together on the rolling surface.Roll and gather the dough to make a spiral shape. Tuck in and press the end portion of the dough in the center. Making Layers – Method 2With a rolling pin, roll the flattened dough ball to a thin and almost transparent layer. Roll each ball as thinly as possible.Lift the rolled dough upwards and gently hold it up. This will bring together the rolled dough into small pleats or folds.Hold one end of the pleated dough, roll it like a spiral and press the last edge on to the center.Making Malabar ParathaPrepare the layered dough balls whichever way you prefer. Place them in a bowl covered with a lid or moist cotton cloth. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes. Cover each layered dough ball as you shape and roll them so that they do not dry out.Heat tawa or a flat cast iron skillet on medium-high to high heat.Take one of the layered dough ball. Roll to about 7 or 7.5 inches using a rolling pin. The rolled dough will shrink by a few inches after you roll it.Place on the hot tawa or skillet. Keep heat to medium high or high. Cook one side until lightly golden and crisp for about 30 seconds and then flip with a spatula or tongs.Spread ½ teaspoon oil all over on this partly cooked side.Cook second side until for 30 seconds and flip again. Drizzle and spread ½ teaspoon oil all over.Flip once or twice and cook until golden and crisp.Press the edges with spatula so that they cook well. Remove from pan and set aside in a plate.You will see the layers easily and they will be browned.This way roast and cook in batches the rest of the parotta. If there is any oil leftover in the bowl (that was used in coating the dough balls) then use it roast the last few batches of parotta.Once you have placed the parotta on a plate, wait for half a minute. With your hands in a clapping motion squish the Malabar Paratha, holding them between your palms so that the layers come up on the surface. Making the layers visible is optional. You can also place them in a roti basket and serve them while still hot or warm. These are best eaten while still hot as they are soft, tender, slightly chewy and crispy.

When one side has slightly browned, flip the paratha.Spread or brush some oil/ghee ( I usually add 1 to 2 teaspoons of oil or ghee) on the browned side.Flip again and brush oil (again 1 to 2 teaspoons oil or ghee) on the other side.Flip once or twice, till you see golden spots on the paratha and they look crisp and well cooked.Serve the aloo gobi paratha hot with fresh yogurt, mango pickle or lemon pickle topped with some butter.",NutritionCalories: 440kcal | Carbohydrates: 71g | Protein: 13g | Fat: 14g | Saturated Fat: 7g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 29mg | Sodium: 645mg | Potassium: 758mg | Fiber: 11g | Sugar: 2g | Vitamin A: 82IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.5mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.2mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 5mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 41mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 11µg | Calcium: 47mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 74µg | Iron: 4mg | Magnesium: 129mg | Phosphorus: 335mg | Zinc: 2mg

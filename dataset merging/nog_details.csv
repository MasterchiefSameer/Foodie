In my Samosa recipe, the dough is made with less water for extra flakiness, and the filling is adapted from my culinary school notes; simple, flavorful, and perfectly balanced. You can deep-fry, bake, or air-fry these samosas based on your preference.",45minutes,45minutes,1hour,12,Samosa,"Snacks, Starters","North Indian, Punjabi",Vegetarian,For making samosa pastry▢ 2 cups (250 grams)  all-purpose flour (maida)▢ 1 teaspoon carom seeds▢ 1 teaspoon salt or add as required▢ 6 tablespoons (50 grams)  Ghee (clarified butter)▢ 7 to 8 tablespoons water or add as required,"Making samosa pastry doughTake the flour, carom seeds, salt in a bowl. Mix well and add ghee.With your fingertips rub the ghee or oil in the flour to get a breadcrumb like consistency.The whole mixture should clump together when joined and not fall apart. Add water in parts and knead to a firm dough. If the dough looks dry or floury, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water and knead.Cover the dough with a moistened napkin and set aside for 30 minutes. Making potato and green peas stuffingSteam or boil the potatoes and peas till are cooked completely. Drain them of any extra water in a colander or sieve. Peel the boiled potatoes and chop them into small cubesDry roast all the whole spices mentioned in the above list until fragrant taking care not to burn them. When the spices are warm or cool at room temperature, grind them in a dry grinder or coffee grinder to a semi-fine or fine powder.Heat oil in a pan. add the cumin seeds and crackle them.Add the ginger and green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.Add the steamed green peas, red chili powder, the freshly ground spice powder, dry mango powder and asafoetida.Stir and sauté on a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the potato cubes. Mix very well and sauté for about 2 to 3 minutes on low heat with frequent stirring.Set aside the potato filling aside to cool at room temperature. Assembling & shaping samosaAfter resting the dough for 30 minutes, divide the dough in 6 equal pieces.Take each piece and roll in your palms first to make a smooth ball.Then roll it with a rolling pin keeping the thickness to 1 mm throughout.Cut with a knife or a pastry cutter through the center of the rolled samosa pastry.With a brush or with your finger tips, spread some water all over the edges. Join the two straight ends forming a cone shape. Press the edges so that they get sealed well.Stuff the prepared samosa cone with the prepared potato-peas stuffing.Pinch a part on the edge (check the video & photos). This helps the samosa to stand once it is shaped.Press both the edges. Be sure there are no cracks.Prepare all the samosa this way and keep covered with a moist kitchen napkin.Frying SamosaNow heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Once the oil becomes hot (test by adding a small piece of dough – it should come up quickly once added to the hot oil). Gently slide the prepared stuffed samosa & quickly reduce the flame to low.Turn over in between and fry until golden. Drain the fried samosa on paper towels to remove excess oil.Fry them in batches. For frying the second batch, again increase the temperature of the oil to medium-heat. Do not overcrowd the pan while frying. Add the samosa and then lower the heat, thereby decreasing the temperature of oil.This way fry all the samosa in batches.Serving suggestionsServe samosa hot or warm with coriander chutney, tamarind chutney or tomato ketchup.They can also be served with a yogurt dip or plain raita. Another way is to serve it with  chana masala (chickpea curry).We usually pair samosa with masala chai or ginger chai.Even bread or pav (Indian bread rolls) can be served with it.Whatever you serve this snack with, remember to have hot masala chai with it.",NutritionServing: 1samosa | Calories: 175kcal | Carbohydrates: 18g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 10g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 17mg | Sodium: 205mg | Potassium: 42mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 75IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 3mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 2µg | Calcium: 9mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 42µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 8mg | Phosphorus: 30mg | Zinc: 1mg

Take besan or gram flour in a mixing bowl or pan.Add turmeric powder, asafoetida, lemon juice, ginger paste, green chilies paste, sugar, oil and salt.Add 1 cup water or as required to make thick yet flowing water. The amount of water required depends on the quality of flour, so add as required.Stir and then add the rava or sooji (semolina). Stir to a smooth thick batter without any lumps.The batter should be thick yet flowing. A quick tip is that if the batter become thin, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons besan. Bring to a boil 2 to 2.5 cups of water in a steamer pan or electric cooker or a stove-top pressure cooker. The amount of water to be added depends on the size of the steamer or pressure cooker.Now add the eno or fruit salt to the batter. Stir briskly and quickly. The fruit salt should be mixed evenly with the batter. Or else you get uneven texture in the khaman.The batter would froth and become bubbly, so you have to be quick.Pour the batter in the greased pan.Steaming khaman dhoklaPlace the pan in a steamer or electric rice cooker or pressure cooker. The water should already be boiling or hot when you place the pan with the batter. When using pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid and cover the cooker tightly with its lid.Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in an electric cooker. If using a pan or pressure cooker, steam for 12 to 15 minutes on a medium to high heat. To check the doneness, insert a toothpick and if it comes out clean, the khaman is done. If the toothpick has the batter on it, then you need to steam for some more time.When the khaman become lukewarm or cool, then with a butter knife gently slid along the edges. Keep a plate or tray on top of the pan.Invert the pan. If greased well, the khaman will easily get inverted on the plate. Slice and keep aside.TemperingIn a small pan, heat oil.Add mustard seeds and let them to crackle.When the mustard seeds are crackling, add the cumin seeds (optional), curry leaves and chopped green chilies (optional).Stir and then add sesame seeds.Fry the sesame seeds for some seconds but do not brown them.Then add water. Be careful while adding water as the mixture sizzles. You can switch off the heat when adding water.Add sugar. Stir and allow the tempering mixture to come to a boil. Make sure that the sugar has dissolved in the water. Then pour this tempering mixture evenly on the steamed and sliced khaman.Garnish with chopped coriander seeds and grated coconut.Serve khaman dhokla straight away or you can store them in an air tight box and then serve later after some minutes or an hour. If serving khaman after many hours, then do not garnish with coconut and coriander leaves. Serving SuggestionsThe sweet, savory, fluffy cakes pair great with any spicy or sweet Indian chutney.You can also serve it with your evening chai.Storing SuggestionsIf you plan to serve khaman after a few hours or next day, then I do not recommend to add coconut or coriander leaves. Simply pour the tempering. Refrigerate the khaman in a covered container. While serving you can warm with a sprinkling of water in a microwave or an oven.If using the instant pot to warm, then steam for 1 to 2 minutes. While serving add the coconut and coriander leaves.

Remove fried cashews with a slotted spoon draining the ghee and keep aside.To the same pan add mustard seeds and let them begin to splutter. Keep the heat to low or medium-low.When the mustard seeds begin to splutter add the chana dal. Stirring often fry chana dal till they look golden and crunchy.Then add the cumin seeds and fry for 4 to 5 seconds.Now add the chopped curry leaves, asafoetida, finely chopped ginger and green chillies.

Let the rava become warm.Making BatterTo the roasted rava, add finely grated carrots, chopped coriander leaves and ½ teaspoon salt or add as required.Next add curd (yogurt) and water as required. Depending on the quality of rava and the thickness of curd, you can adjust the water from ½ to ¾ cup.If the curd is liquid and has whey in it, then add ½ cup water. If the curd is very thick, then add ¾ cup water. Basically you need to get a medium consistency batter.Mix very well and let the batter rest covered for 20 minutes. The rava idli batter is neither thick nor thin in consistency and has a medium consistency.Brush oil or ghee on the idli pan moulds. Place a fried halved cashew in the center of the moulds.Also heat 2 to 2.5 cups water in a pot. Keep a small length trivet stand or a rack in the pot. Heat the water till it comes to a boil.After 20 minutes this is the consistency of the batter after resting. If in case the batter looks thick, rava idli batter looks thick, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to get a medium consistency. Rava absorbs water and so the batter might thicken after 20 minutes. If the curd is thick, then also you may need to add more water. If you have added more water in the beginning, then you may not need to any water at this step. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon eno or ¼ teaspoon baking soda evenly over the batter. Quickly mix very well.Steaming Rava IdliPour the batter in the idli moulds. Place them in the pot with the hot water. Cover with a lid and steam rava idli for 10 to 12 minutes on medium heat.To check the doneness, a bamboo skewer or fork inserted in the rava idli should come out clean.

Add all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix well.Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.With your thumb make a hole in the center. You can also use banana leaves or ziplock bags to give the medu vada its donut shape.Making Medu VadaIn a kadai (wok) or pan heat oil for deep frying. Keep the heat to medium. Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil. Shape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don't overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. A very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then too the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil. Similarly fry remaining batches of medu vada with the batter.Any leftover batter can be refrigerated for about a day. Let the chilled batter come to room temperature before frying.Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. Medu vada can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.One of the best combination is sambar vada where these medu vadai are dunked in piping hot sambar and served with a side of coconut chutney.

When the mixture becomes warm, then use your fingertips to thoroughly combine. Set aside.In a sauce pan heat water until it starts boiling.Add this hot water in parts to the flour mixture. Mix with a spoon.Add more hot water as required. Mix with a spoon first and then using slightly damp hands knead to a firm yet pliable dough. Cover and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.Making chakliApply some water in the chakli/murukku maker and place a portion of the dough inside it.Tighten the lid and press the chakli maker to prepare the chakli. Move in rounds to get a spiral shape. Make the chakli on butter paper or aluminium foil, so thats it is easy to remove them.TIP – If the chakli breaks while forming them, this means that the dough does not have enough moisture. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water and knead the dough again.TIP – If you are not getting proper shape, this mean that the dough is too moist. Add some flour and knead again.Break the dough towards the end and press it to the last concentric circle of the spiral.FryingHeat oil for deep frying in a pan. Take a small piece of the dough and check the temperature of the oil. If the dough comes up gradually, then the oil is ready. If the dough sits at the bottom, the oil is still cold. If the piece of dough comes up briskly and quickly, the oil is too hot.TIP – Have a bite into the fried piece of dough and if it tastes hard, add ½ or 1 tablespoon of hot oil or butter to the dough and knead again.Lift the chakli gently and slid into the hot oil.Fry 3 to 4 chakli at a time. Do not over crowd the kadai or pan while frying.TIP – Check the first batch of chakli. If it looks like the chakli has absorbed oil or breaks in oil, then add some rice flour, about 1 to 2 tablespoons and knead again. This happens if too much fat has gone in the dough.Fry them until crisp and golden.Drain them on paper towels to remove extra oil.Make chakli with the remaining dough on the parchment paper. Cover them with a dry kitchen napkin, so that they don't dry out.Fry the remaining batches in the same way. Once they come at room temperature, then store them in an airtight box or jar. Keep the jar in a cool dry place at room temperature.

This fail-proof Maharashtrian style Sabudana Vada recipe gives you a super delicious crispy vada with a soft and light interior.",5hours,30minutes,5hours,18,Sabudana Vada,"Breakfast, Snacks",Maharashtrian,"Gluten Free, Vegan","▢ 1 cup sabudana (sago or tapioca pearls)▢ 4 potatoes – medium-sized▢ ½ cup peanuts▢ 1 teaspoon cumin seeds – optional▢ 1 to 2 green chillies – finely chopped or ½ to 1 teaspoon ▢ 1 teaspoon ginger – finely chopped▢ 2 teaspoons lemon juice (optional)▢ 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves –  optional▢ 1.5 teaspoon sugar or as required▢ 1 to 2 tablespoons buckwheat flour or amaranth flour – optional▢ rock salt (edible and food grade) or sendha namak▢ oil as required, for deep frying","Soaking SabudanaYou need to plan ahead and soak the sago pearls. It is very important to soak the sago really well.Important: Please refrain from using un-soaked or under-soaked sabudana to avoid scalding or burns as they will burst and shatter in oil when frying.First optionally, using a colander or mesh strainer rinse 1 cup sabudana lightly twice draining all the water.Soak the sabudana or sago in water for 5 hours at least or overnight. I soaked the sago pearls overnight and by morning they had become soft.When properly soaked, the sabudana pearls will be tender without any hard center. When you press the pearls between your forefinger and thumb, they should get mashed easily with a floury moist texture on your fingers.If you feel some hardness in the center, then soak for some more time. Drain all the water really well from the soaked sabudana.There should not be any water logged in the soaked pearls. Water will make the patties moist and sticky. The patties will soak up a good amount of oil while frying making them loaded with oil. So drain the water really well. You can opt to gently and lightly press the soaked pearls in the strainer with a spoon or spatula. Or set aside the pearls in a strainer (keeping a bowl beneath) for some 20 to 30 minutes dripping of any extra water.After draining the water thoroughly transfer the sabudana in a mixing bowl and set aside.Cooking PotatoesScrub and rinse 4 medium-sized potatoes thoroughly in water first. 1. Stove-top pressure cooker:  Place the potatoes in a 3 litre cooker. Add water which just about covers the potatoes. Pressure cook potatoes for 10 to 12 minutes or 4 to 5 whistles on medium heat.When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, open the lid and check the potatoes. Pass a knife or fork through the center of the potatoes and it should slide easily without any resistance.2. Cooking in a pan: Take water and add peeled and chopped potatoes. The water should cover the potatoes. Add a 2 to 3 pinches of salt if preferred.Cover and simmer potatoes until fork tender. Drain the water really well. When the potatoes are tender, using a strainer, drain all the water. 3. For Instant Pot cooking: Place a trivet in the inner steel of your Instant Pot. Add 1.5 cups water. Place the rinsed potatoes on the trivet. Seal with the lid and position the valve to sealing. Press the manual/pressure cook button and set the time to 10 or 12 minutes with high pressure option.After you hear the beep when the pressure cooking is complete, wait for 5 minutes and then do a quick pressure release. Remove the potatoes with tongs and place them in a plate or tray. Check the potatoes to see if they are cooked tender with a fork or knife.Let the potatoes become warm. Later peel and then chop them or mash them.Roasting PeanutsOn a skillet or in a shallow pan, roast the groundnuts/peanuts till they become crisp and crunchy.Cool and then coarsely powder in a mortar-pestle or in a dry grinder. You can even make a fine powder.Making Sago MixtureAdd the mashed potatoes and coarsely ground roasted groundnuts to the sabudana in the mixing bowl.Add edible rock salt, cumin seeds, sugar, ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves and lemon juice to the sabudana . Mix the entire mixture very well.Now take some portion of the mixture in your hands and shape them into flat round vada or patty. Set aside.Repeat until you use up the entire dough mixture.Making Sabudana VadaHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai. Add a tiny ball made from the mixture.Fry it on medium flame. If this ball does not break while frying, then you are good to go. If it breaks, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of rajgira atta (or amaranth flour) to the mixture and mix well.Now gently place the vada in the oil. Keep the heat to medium or medium-high while frying. If the oil is warm, the vada will absorb a lot of oil and become soggy.Add the vada for frying depending on the size of the kadai. Do not crowd the kadai or pan.When one side gets golden, then only flip the vada. Otherwise, don't even touch as they might break if not cooked.Turn over a couple of times so as to fry the sabudana vada evenly. Fry until they are crisp and goldenRemove them with a slotted spoon. Place on kitchen paper towels to absorb excess oil. Fry the remaining batches of the patties this way.Serve Sabudana Vada hot or warm. Serving SuggestionsSabudana Vada can be made for fasting days or as an evening snack.It pairs well with coconut chutney, sweetened curd (just mix in some sugar), coriander chutney, tamarind chutney, or even tomato ketchup.Make Ahead OptionsFor prep ahead, boil and mash potatoes a day earlier, and roast and powder peanuts. Soaked sabudana can also be refrigerated after draining water.The patties can be shaped in advance and kept in the fridge. Any leftover mixture keeps well in the fridge for 1 to 2 days.",NutritionCalories: 107kcal | Carbohydrates: 17g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 4g | Saturated Fat: 0.5g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Sodium: 88mg | Potassium: 233mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.05mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.03mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 0.2mg | Vitamin C: 10mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 10mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 12µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 21mg | Phosphorus: 45mg | Zinc: 0.3mg

Depending on the size, you can grind in 2 to 3 batches or in one go.Grind to a fine powder.Remove the ground sambar powder on a plate. If grinding in batches, remove the ground masala on a plate and mix very well. Due to grinding the sambar powder will become warm.Once the sambar powder cools at room temperature, then spoon it carefully in a jar.Do tap and shake the jar, so that the sambar podi settles down while filling the jar.Close tightly with a lid and keep at room temperature. Use as needed when making any recipes with it.Usage and Storage SuggestionsAdd sambar powder to any of the sambar recipes you make. For a serving of 4, add about 2 to 3 teaspoons of this sambar masala.Store the sambar masala powder in a clean air-tight jar in a dry, cool place. When taking the spice mix from the jar, always use a dry spoon. Never use a wet spoon.Note that if any moisture or water goes into the jar, it will deteriorate the spice blend and may get moldy or have fungus. After you are done with taking the required amount of sambar masala for your recipe, close the jar well with its lid.This sambar powder keeps well for 3 to 4 months in a dry and cool place. Store it in a cool and dry place in your kitchen which does not have any moisture. if you live in a hot and humid region then store in the refrigerator.",NutritionCalories: 13kcal | Carbohydrates: 2g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 30mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 208IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 45mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 79mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 30mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 464µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 7mg | Phosphorus: 9mg | Zinc: 1mg

You can choose to leave out cooking green peas if you do not want to stuff the patties. Cooking in Stovetop Pressure CookerIn a 3 or 4 litre stovetop pressure cooker take 4 to 5 large potatoes and 2.5 cups water. Place a small trivet and keep a bowl containing ½ cup green peas in it. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles on medium to medium-high flame.Remove the cooker's lid after all the pressure falls naturally in the cooker.Cooking in Instant PotTake the trivet that comes with the Instant pot package. Place this trivet in the steel insert of a 6 quart IP. Add 2.5 cups of water. On top of the trivet, Place 4 to 5 large potatoes and also keep a small bowl containing ½ cup green peas. Pressure cook on high for 20 to 25 minutes in the Instant Pot. Do a quick pressure release after 5 to 7 minutes after the cooking is complete.Check with a knife or fork to see if the potatoes are tender and cooked well. The fork or knife should be able to slid easily if the potatoes are cooked properly.Making green peas stuffingDrain the water from the steamed green peas using a small strainer or colander. Take the peas in a bowl and mash them.Mash to a coarse texture.To the peas, add red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, coriander powder, fennel powder, dry mango powder, finely chopped ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves, black salt and regular salt as per taste.Mix very well. Check taste and add more salt or the ground spice powders if required.Making potato patty mixtureMeanwhile drain the water from the potatoes as well and let them become warm.When the potatoes are warm, then peel them and grate. I find it easier to grate the potatoes and then mash them. However, you can chop them first and mash with a potato masher. Let the grated or mashed potatoes cool completely.After the mashed potatoes have cooled completely, add the following ingredients: red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, garam masala powder or curry powder, coriander powder, dry mango powder, black salt and regular salt as per taste.Next add bread crumbs and arrowroot flour. Instead of arrowroot flour, you can also add rice flour, corn flour (corn starch) or tapioca starch or roasted besan (roasted chickpea flour or roasted gram flour).Mix everything thoroughly.Stuffing and Shaping Aloo TikkiDivide the mixture into small or medium shaped patties with a hollow center or cup shaped discs.

This can take a good amount of time, and I like to prepare a large batch at once to keep in the fridge for about a week or so and have ready as needed.After plucking the leaves rinse them thoroughly in cool running water in a large bowl. Firstly soak the leaves in enough water for a few minutes. Add some vinegar and baking soda to the water. This gets rid of pesticides if any.Swish and move them with your hands, so that they are cleaned thoroughly of any soil or mud clinging on the stems. This needs to get washed off. See that the leaves are clean and devoid of any muddy particles on them.Drain all the water and soak them in fresh water for a few more minutes. Drain the water. Repeat this process once or twice. Finally, drain all the water.Now chop the fenugreek leaves. You could do this with a knife or chop them in a food processor. While chopping in the food processor, make sure you do not chop it to fine or make a paste of it.Preparing potatoesRinse, peel and chop the potatoes into small cubes or squares.In a heavy skillet, kadai or pan, heat up the oil. Add the potatoes first.Saute the potatoes for some minutes on medium-low to medium heat until they start looking crisp and are lightly browned from the edges.Add the chopped green chilies and asafoetida. Stir. If you don't have green chilies, add about ¼ to ½ teaspoon of red chili powder or cayenne pepper.Making aloo methiNow add the chopped methi (fenugreek leaves). Mix very well.Add salt. Give a good stir, and let the aloo methi continue to cook for a couple of minutes uncovered on medium-low to medium heat. When the methi begins to produce water, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 to 6 more minutes on a low to medium-low heat. The liquid should be totally evaporated in the dish and the fenugreek leaves will become completely wilted.Sauté for a couple more minutes to get the potatoes and methi nice and dry.If your potatoes are not quite cooked when the liquid has dried up, add a tablespoon or so of water and continue to cook.Later, if you see any extra water in the pan, then simmer until all the water is dried up.Once cooked, you can either mix in a bit of butter for extra rich flavor or serve plain as-is. Serving suggestionsServe aloo methi with Indian breads like paratha, roti, naan.  You could even make this dish as a side vegetable with your Indian main course.StorageUsually there won't be any leftovers. If there are leftovers then place in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Reheat by simply warming up in a small pan or skillet sprinkling few drops of water.

Then lower the flame, add the urad dal.Roast urad dal on a low heat for about 2 minutes, stirring often. Urad dal is roasted just to get rid of some moisture from them.Then add the thick poha or thick flattened rice.Mix very well and roast for a minute on low heat. Remove the pan from the stove top and let this mixture cool down.Then add everything in a grinder jar. Grind to a fine powder.Keep a large plate or tray or pan and place a sieve on it. Take the ground flour in the fine seive and sift it.Some urad dal grits will be there. You can add them to your dals or discard.Add rice flour and salt. Mix thoroughly.The idli mix flour is ready to be bottled. With a dry and clean spoon, add the idli mix flour in a jar. Seal tightly with a lid. Use the idli mix flour when required.StorageStore in a cool and dry place in your kitchen. You can also choose to refrigerate or freeze the ildi flour.When removing the idli flour, always use a clean dry spoon or a clean dry cup. If water or moisture seeps into the flour, it will get spoiled.Making instant idliFirst grease the idli plates very well with oil. Also heat 2 to 2.5 cups water in a pot, idli steamer, 5 litre pressure cooker or an electric cooker.In a mixing bowl take the prepared idli mix flour and sour curd.Add water in parts. So you can add ⅓ to ½ cup water first.Then begin to mix with a wired whisk. A wired whisk works best as it helps to dissolve the lumps in the batter.Add more water and continue to mix. Overall you can add ⅔ to ¾ cup of water. Mix very well. You can briskly whisk this mixture for a minute to aerate it a bit.Remember to use a wired whisk to make a smooth lump free batter.You need to get a batter which is thick yet flowing, almost like an idli batter.Sprinkle the fruit salt or eno all over the batter evenly. As soon as you add eno, mix very well and be quick. Do mix the eno very well with the batter. Otherwise you will have a faint green color on the idlis as well as uneven texture in them.Pour the batter in the prepared idli moulds. Carefully place the idli stand in the pot or idli steamer or 5 litre pressure cooker or an electric cooker.When you place the idli stand in the pot or steamer, the water will be hot. So place it carefully.Cover with the lid of the pot or the Idli steamer. Steam the idlis for 10 to 12 minutes or till they are done and a tooth pick or fork inserted in the idlis, comes out clean. Note: If you have used a stovetop 5 litre pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid. Place the idli stand carefully in the cooker as the water will be hot. Then seal the lid (without the vent weight/whistle) tightly on to the cooker and steam the idlis on medium to medium-high heat for 10 to 12 minutes.These idlis cook faster. So do keep a check. Do not overcook as then they will become hard.Once done, remove them and allow to sit for a few minutes.Then with a butter knife gently remove the idlis from the mould. Place them in a casserole.

These dainty small dosas are served in a set of three and thus referred to as Set Dosa.",9hours,30minutes,9hours,4,,Breakfast,"Karnataka, South Indian","Gluten Free, Vegan","▢ 1 cup idli rice or dosa rice or parboiled rice – 200 grams idli dosa rice▢ ½ cup poha (flattened rice), thick variety – 50 grams▢ 2 tablespoons urad dal▢ 7 to 8 fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)▢ 1.5 cups water for soaking▢ ¾ cup water or rice+lentils soaked water for grinding, add as required▢ ¼ teaspoon sugar▢ ½ teaspoon rock salt (edible and food grade) or sea salt or add as per taste▢ ¼ teaspoon baking soda▢ oil or butter or ghee as required","Soaking rice and lentilsIn a bowl or pan, take the following ingredients – rice, urad dal, 7 to 8 fenugreek seeds. I have used idli rice. You can also use short grained regular rice like sona masuri rice.Rinse all the ingredients for a couple of times in water. Drain and set aside.Next, in a separate bowl or pan or cup, take the thick poha. Rinse the poha once or twice with water.Strain and add the poha to the bowl containing rice, urad dal, methi seeds.Add 1.5 cups of water and soak all the ingredients for 5 to 6 hours.Later, drain the soaked water very well. Reserve the strained water. We will use this strained water for grinding. Or opt to use fresh water while grinding the rice and lentilsMaking sponge dosa batterNow add half of the soaked ingredients in a high speed grinder or blender. Depending on the size of the jar, you can grind in one lot or in batches.Add ½ cup water and grind very well. The rice grains can have a consistency of that like idli rawa.Pour this batter in a large bowl or pan. I ground in two batches. For the first round, I added ½ cup water and for the next batch I added ¼ cup water. I added a total of ¾ cup water while grinding. If the grinder becomes hot, then wait for it to cool down and then continue with the grinding.Add sugar to the batter in the bowl.Mix very well. Cover with a lid and let the batter ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more depending on the temperature conditions in your city.Before preparing dosa, add salt and baking soda. You can add the salt as per your taste.Mix very well. The soda should be evenly distributed in the dosa batter.In case if the batter looks thick, you can add some more water. I did add ¼ cup water before preparing the dosas. Mix very well after you add water.Cooking set dosa – Method 1Heat an iron tawa or skillet. In the center, spread some oil. For nonstick pan, you need not grease the pan with oil. The tawa has to be medium hot and not very hot. If very hot, the dosa gets too browned or can get burnt with uneven cooking. If the tawa is warm, then the dosa does not become soft and the air-pockets do not get formed on the dosa. While making these dosas, you can regulate the heat from low to medium.Take a ladle of the batter and gently pour it on the tawa. Just spread the batter very lightly to make a small and slightly thick dosa.Drizzle some oil on the sides as well as on the top. You can also top the set dosa with some grated carrots, beetroots, curry leaves, chopped onions and green chilies.When the base become golden and crisp, flip the dosa.When the second side also gets golden and crisp, lift the dosa with a spatula and serve. You can also place the set dosa in a warm casserole.Cooking Sponge Dosa – Method 2This is the usual method of cooking these dosas – first spread the batter and drizzle some oil on the sides and top.Lower the heat and cover the dosa with a lid.Remove the lid when the top is firm and done. Use any method that suits you to make these dosas. Prepare the dosas this way. If you have a large tawa, then you can make 2 to 3 set dosa at the same time.Serve with coconut chutney, vegetable korma, sambar or potato masala.",NutritionCalories: 354kcal | Carbohydrates: 63g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 8g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.4g | Monounsaturated Fat: 6g | Sodium: 369mg | Potassium: 78mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 0.3g | Vitamin A: 1IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.3mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.05mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin C: 0.4mg | Vitamin E: 3mg | Vitamin K: 0.4µg | Calcium: 20mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 118µg | Iron: 3mg | Magnesium: 22mg | Phosphorus: 79mg | Zinc: 1mg

Then peel them. Then slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness. Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato.Then begin to cut them in sticks having 1 cm width. Rinse these potato sticks for a couple of times in water to get rid of the extra starch. Soaking PotatoesIn a bowl take 3.5 cups cold water and place the potatoes in it. Keep this bowl outside or in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 45 minutes. In a hot and humid climate keep the bowl in the fridge.After 30 minutes or 45 minutes, drain the potatoes in a colander.Rinsing and Drying Potato SticksRinse the potatoes in clean fresh water using a colander or mesh strainer. Drain all the water. Then place them on clean kitchen cotton napkin.Fold the napkin above and press, pat and dry the potatoes. The potatoes have to be completely dried before you begin to fry them. First FryingHeat oil in a wok or pan over medium-low or medium heat. For a heavy pan, keep medium heat and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low heat. The oil should have a temperature of 135 degrees Celsius (275 degrees Fahrenheit).Now, working in batches, add the potatoes to the oil. Do not overcrowd the wok (kadai) or pan with the potatoes. The oil will sizzle and bubble less when you fry the potatoes at this temperature.Stir at intervals while frying them for uniform cooking.Fry/blanch in oil for about 3 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not brown from outside. They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.Place the half fried potatoes on paper kitchen towels. Stack 3 to 4 paper towels. Press some paper towels from top also to absorb extra oil. Let the half fried potatoes cool down at room temperature. Note that after removing this batch, you can fry the second batch of potatoes. By the time you fry the second batch of the potatoes, the first batch will cool down. So even though you have to fry twice, you’re using the same batch of oil all the way through. Second FryingNow increase the heat to a medium-high or high. Again here for a heavy pan, use a high heat and for a less heavy pan, use medium-high heat. The oil should be hot on medium-high to high heat having a temperature of 180 to 185 degrees celsius (356 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit).Add the first batch of once-fried potatoes to the hot oil. The oil will sizzle and bubble quickly and as soon as you add the potatoes.Stir often while the potatoes fry to cook them evenly. Fry french fries for 3 minutes or until crisp and golden. The edges should become golden. Remove with a slotted spoon.Place french fries on paper tissues again to remove the extra oil.Making Air Fried French FriesAfter drying them thoroughly, mix and coat the potato sticks with 2 tablespoons oil. Take a batch and line the sticks evenly in the air-fryer basket. You can also line the potatoes on a parchment paper in the basket. Before air-frying, preheat the air-fryer at 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 to 6 minutes.Place the air-fryer basket with the potato sticks in the air-fryer. Air-fry for about a total time of 10 to 12 minutes.Half way through after about 5 to 6 minutes, shake the basket or turn over each fry with tongs or a spoon. Air fry again for 5 to 6 minutes until golden.Remove the air-fried fries in a bowl. Work in batches this way and make air-fryer french fries.Serving SuggestionsWhile still hot, take the french fries (whether deep fried or air-fried) in a bowl. Sprinkle with some salt, paprika or red chili flakes, dried herbs or dry rosemary. You can add your choice of herbs and spices.Gently shake and toss the bowl so that the salt, herbs mix evenly with the friesServe these homemade french fries hot with any dip or sauce of your choice.Tomato ketchup and Cilantro Chutney are our favorite dips to go with french fries. We also like to serve with some Eggless Mayonnaise.Make Ahead and StorageFor freezing and storing french fries in large quantities, fry/blanch the potatoes in hot oil first for about 3 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Wipe the extra oil with kitchen paper towels and when cooled, line the half-fried potatoes on a tray. Cover the tray with a kitchen napkin and freeze for an hour. Remove the frozen fries from the tray and transfer to a zip-lock bag or a container and store in your freezer.Now you can deep fry, bake or air-fry these frozen fries. When cooking the fries with any of these methods, you do not need to thaw the frozen finger chips. While deep frying, heat oil until medium or medium-high hot and deep fry the fries until golden and crisp. Sprinkle salt or ground spices, herbs and serve straight away. Remove and add in salt and herbs.

Then place them in a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Add water just about covering the potatoes. Also add ½ teaspoon salt. Pressure cook the potatoes for 5 to 6 whistles on medium to medium-high heat.When pressure settles down on its own, then only open the lid. Then check the potatoes with a knife, and it should slid easily. Drain all the water and set aside the potatoes. Let them become warm or cool at room temperature.Making potato stuffingThen peel and grate them in a bowl. You can even mash them with a potato masher or fork.Add chopped coriander leaves and finely chopped green chilies.Add all the spice powders – red chilli powder, black pepper powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder and dry mango powder.Also add salt as per taste. Mix very well. Check the taste and add more spice powders, salt and dry mango powder if required.Take a portion of the mixture and make small to medium rolls of potato filling. The size of the rolls will depend on the size of the bread.Take the bread slices and slice off the side crusts.Preparing bread slicesTake ⅓ cup water in a plate or a bowl. Dip one bread slice in the water completely.Simply keep the bread in water and remove after 1 to 2 seconds. Let the bread absorb the water. It should get damp but not overly. Otherwise the bread slice breaks. The idea is to make the bread moist enough so that it becomes pretty flexible which would make the rolling and shaping easier.Press the bread between your palms so that the excess water is drained.Make sure the bread stays intact and does not break. So press gently.Now place the bread on a tray or board or plate.Making bread rollPlace the prepared potato stuffing roll on one side of the moist bread slice.Gently roll the bread and join the edges.Press the edges and seal them. Also press the top and bottom parts and seal them.You should get a neat bread roll. Also there should not be any uncovered potato filling as when frying they will leak out in the oil. If there are any uncovered edges, then simply cover with a piece of soaked and drained bread and press it to get an even cover. Forming the bread roll is not so easy part for beginners and with practice you will learn.Shape and make bread rolls this way with the remaining bread slices.Frying bread rollHeat any neutral flavored oil for deep frying or shallow frying bread rolls in a kadai or pan. When the oil becomes medium hot, then add the bread roll. Do not over crowd the kadai. Add 3 to 4 bread rolls depending on the size of the kadai. The oil has to be moderately hot. If the oil is not hot enough, the moist bread will absorb a lot of oil. If the oil is very hot, the bread will brown quickly and unevenly with uncooked insides.Fry them till they become crisp and light golden in color.Then turn over each bread roll with a slotted spoon.Continue to fry and turn over as required for uniform frying. Fry till they look crisp and golden.Then using a slotted spoon remove them draining as much oil as possible in the kadai or pan.Place them on kitchen paper towels for extra oil to be absorbed. While still hot serve them. In the same way, fry the rest of the bread rolls.Serve bread roll hot or warm with your favorite accompaniment like tomato sauce or green chutney or cilantro chutney or mint chutney.",NutritionCalories: 115kcal | Carbohydrates: 17g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 3g | Sodium: 248mg | Potassium: 244mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 20IU | Vitamin C: 5.4mg | Calcium: 43mg | Iron: 2.1mg

Drain all the water. Then wipe them dry with a kitchen towel. You can even keep them spread on a plate and let them dry naturally. The bhindi should be completely dry before you proceed with the second step.Slice of the crown part of each bhindi. This part is discarded. Then slice off the base tip. This part is also discarded.Next, with a knife give a slit on the bhindi without breaking it into two parts. The entire bhindi (okra) should be intact. With clean thumbs and fingers gently open the sliced part and check to see if there are any worms. If there are worms or black spots, then discard the bhindi.Repeat the above slicing steps with all of the bhindi. Making Stuffing MasalaCombine all the ground spices and salts listed under ""Ground Spices Stuffing"" section above except asafoetida in a bowl. Mix very well.Stuff the spice mix in each bhindi with a small spoon or with your fingers.Repeat with the entire lot of bhindi.Making bharwa bhindiTake a heavy pan or kadai (wok) large enough that can accommodate the okra in one single layer.Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in it. Keep heat to a low or medium-low and add 1 pinch asafoetida (hing). Stir and mix with oil. If you do not have asafoetida, then skip it.Then immediately add the stuffed bhindi in the oil and gently stir to combine with the oil.If any masala remains you can add it to the bhindi in the kadai. Also, add the masala which must have fallen on the chopping board while stuffing bhindi.Gently mix and stir again. Cook the stuffed bhindi on a low to medium-low heat.Do not cover the kadai with any lid as this can make the okra slimy. Let the bhindi cook on a low to medium-low heat. We don't want the masala to burn hence the bhindi needs to be cooked on a low to medium-low heat. Also do not add any water.The bhindi should not be on top of each other. Hence arrange them separately in a single layer on the kadai/pan, so that each bhindi is evenly cooked.Ensure that you check the bhindi in between and also give a gently stir after every 3 to 4 minutes. After giving a stir make sure each stuffed bhindi is arranged separately in a single layer. This helps in even cooking.Slow cook until the bhindi is tender and well cooked. At this point, check taste of bhindi and if the salt is less then sprinkle some salt from above and stir to combine.Final TouchesTake the kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) in your palms. Crush kasuri methi between your palms, and sprinkle on the bhindi.If you do not have kasuri methi, then skip adding.Also add garam masala powder. Mix very well and turn off the heat.Lastly, add the chopped coriander leaves and mix again. Instead of coriander leaves you can also use mint leaves.Serving SuggestionsServe Bharwa Bhindi hot or warm, with roti and yogurt or raita.

Set it aside.Grate the mooli (white radish) and set aside for 15 to 20 minutes and later squeeze the water from it. This is done so that the mooli paratha do not break while rolling the dough. This radish juice can be used to make the dough instead of water.Add chopped green chilies to the grated mooli.Rolling mooli parathaNow take two lemon sized ball from the dough and roll them into a small circle, about 5 to 6 cms on the rolling board dusted with wheat flour.Take a good amount of the mooli stuffing and place it on one of the rolled dough. Don’t use too much stuffing as in that case the mooli parathas can break while rolling.Sprinkle evenly one or two pinch of salt, red chilli powder and garam masala powder. Cover with the other rolled round and join the edges.In the meantime, heat the griddle or tava. Roll the dough into the size of a paratha or roti. Care should be taken while rolling the dough as the paratha may break.We have added salt to the mooli and thus as a result some juice will start oozing out from the mooli paratha. Its ok.Making mooli parathaHeat a tawa (skillet) and place the paratha on the tawa. The tawa should be medium hot. Also keep the flame to medium-high to high. Don't roast the paratha on a low flame.

A well-fried paratha will have some brown spots and might puff up little. Make sure that the paratha edges are fried well. You can use spatula to press them.You can flip the paratha a couple of times till you see brown spots and the paratha is cooked evenly. The paratha should become golden and crisp from both sides. Make all parathas this way. Serve Punjabi Mooli Paratha hot with butter or curd or the pickle of your choice. You can also pack them in a lunch box.

Depending on your jar capacity, you can grind the rice in two to three batches. For the first round I added ½ cup water and for the next round I added ¼ cup water.

In a warmer climate, add salt before you keep the batter for fermentation.Steaming ragi idliGrease the idli moulds with oil. Pour the batter in the idli moulds.Before placing the idli stand, add 2 to 2.5 cups water in an electric cooker or steamer or pressure cooker. Bring this water to a boil.Then place the idli stand in the hot water. For an electric cooker and steamer cover with its lid and steam. For pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the cooker and secure the lid tightly on the cooker.Steam ragi idli for 12 to 15 minutes. Depending on the equipment you have used, it may takes less or more time. A tooth pick inserted in the center of the ragi idlis should come out clean and not be sticky. Allow a standing time of 1 to 2 minutes. You can steam the ragi idli in batches. The leftover batter can be refrigerated and you can make dosa or uttapam.Dip a spoon or butter knife in water and slid them through the idlis.

Whisk the batter with a spoon or a wired whisk for about 2 minutes to aerate it. Taste test the batter and add more salt or spices if needed.Slicing potatoesRinse, peel and slice the potatoes thinly into rounds. Do not cut the potato slices too thin or transparent or thick. Using very thin potato slices will cause the pakoras to crisp up while frying and you want the potatoes to be soft and tender when cooked. Thick slices would make up for undercooked potato after being fried.Deep Frying Heat oil for frying in a kadai (wok) or pan on medium heat. The oil has to be medium-hot before you begin to fry. Dip each potato slice in the batter. Coat it evenly with the batter. Place the batter coated potato slice gently and carefully in the medium-hot oil.Batter coat 5 to 6 potato slices or more depending on the size of your pan and place them in the hot oil. When one side is light golden or golden, turn over the pakora with a slotted spoon. Fry the second side until crisp and golden. Turn over as needed a few times for even frying. Fry until golden and crispy. Using a slotted spoon remove them from oil and place on paper towels to remove excess oil.Fry the potato fritters in batches this way until golden and crisp. If you have leftover batter after frying all the potato slices, then slice more potatoes to use up the remaining batter. Serve aloo pakora hot or warm.Serving SuggestionsEnjoy aloo pakora with any of your favorite Indian dips like coriander chutney, tamarind chutney, mint chutney, coconut chutney, or ketchup.For a bright tangy flavor, sprinkle ½ to 1 teaspoon of chaat masala powder or a few pinches of black salt on the pakora. Serve these potato bajji as an evening snack with chai or coffee. I also serve these pakoras with the Mexican avocado dip guacamole and it is so yum. On occasions I make a pakora wrap filled with aloo pakora, guacamole and cilantro chutney. You could make burgers or sliders with these potato fritters or aloo bajji.

Add water. Pressure cook for 7 to 8 minutes on a medium to high heat.Read on below in the notes section on cooking lentils in the Instant pot or in a pan. The lentils have to be cooked completely and softened really well. Mash the dal very well with a wired whisk or with a spoon.

Drizzle a bit of ghee on the dal if you like. Have a complete meal by pairing the dal and rice with a side of any Indian vegetable dish or salad or raita or a plain yogurt.You can relish the dal with some soft roti or crispy paratha or even bread or dinner rolls (pav). StorageIt is best to eat Gujarati dal when freshly cooked. Lentils always taste best when served hot and as soon as they are cooked. If you have leftovers, then store in the refrigerator and try to consume the same day or at the most next day. Dal when refrigerated, will thicken with a change in flavor and taste. Refrigerated dal does not taste as better or good than freshly cooked dal. Moreover I suggest that for health reasons, it is best to eat dal the day it is made.

This is to get rid of any dampness or moisture in them.Also, sun dry fenugreek seeds and red chili powder for 4 to 5 hours. Meanwhile, soak the unripe mangoes in water for 1 hour. Then, rinse them well and if there is any sticky sap which has dried on the mangoes, rub the mangoes in your palms when rinsing to remove the dried sap.Remove the mangoes. Dry them with a clean kitchen towel or naturally.Chopping mangoesBefore chopping mangoes, they should be completely dry. There should not be any trace of moisture or water on the mangoes.Firstly, slice the mango in halves from its center. This is very difficult as the kernel is hard and the knife does not cut it easily. So please avoid, if you cannot do this chopping.Then, take each halve and remove the seeds carefully with a knife. The kernel part will be intact on the mangoes. Now, halve the mango vertically from the center first. Then, cut horizontally.This chopping is also difficult, so avoid if you cannot do this. The mango should be chopped into bite size pieces.Take the mango pieces and remove the thin paper like covering from the kernel part with a spoon or with your hands. Make sure that your hands are clean.Take the chopped mangoes in a large pan or bowl. Cover and keep aside.Making avakaya pachadiTake the mustard seeds. They should be warm before you grind them. Add in a mixer or grinder-jar or a spice grinder and grind to a semi fine powder. Remove the mustard powder and add to mango pieces.In the same jar, add fenugreek seeds.Grind to a semi fine powder and add to the mango pieces.Now. add the red chili powder. Add the white chickpeas.

If using sea salt crystals, then powder in a mixer and then add.Mix very well with a large spoon.Add turmeric powder and mix very well.Now, add sesame oil or gingelly oil. Use cold pressed sesame oil (kachchi ghani) and not refined sesame oil. Mix very well and thoroughly with a large spoon.Storing avakaiCover with a lid (not tightly) and keep the mango Avakaya in a dry place for 4 to 5 days. You can also keep in sunlight for a few hours on 4 to 5 days. Alternatively, you can even add the mango mixture in a glass or ceramic jar.Everyday or alternate day, remove the lid and mix the pickle with a clean spoon. You can sun dry the spoon for some minutes before you mix the pickle.On the fourth or fifth day, you will see oil floating on top of the pickle and the mango pieces would have already softened. Mix again with a clean spoon.Add the pickle in a clean jar or bottle. Do wash the glass jar or bottle and then sun dry it for a day before storing the pickle. Pour some sesame oil in the pickle jars which just covers the pickle on top by 1.5 to 2 inches. Close the lid and refrigerate. You can even keep the pickle in a dry place for 2 to 3 days more and then refrigerate.Serving avakaya pachadiWhen serving avakai, remove the portion you want in a small jar from the main jar and then serve with your everyday meals.

If you do not have coconut oil, then you can use sunflower oil or any oil for frying. Keep the heat to medium.For slicing bananas its better to use a mandoline slicer as the slices are thin. Thin slices make for crispy chips.Add a thin slice of one or two banana chips in the oil. If they come up steadily on top, the oil is ready. The oil has to be medium hot, so fry on medium heat. Do not fry on low heat as the banana chips will absorb too much oil.Using the mandoline slicer directly slice the banana over the oil. Be careful while doing so. Alternatively you can slice the banana chips in a tray or plate and add the slices in the oil.As soon as you add the slices stir them with a slotted spoon. Do not overcrowd the kadai with the banana slices while frying.Begin to fry on medium heat and in between you can turn over the banana chips.Keep on turning them and frying until they become lightly crisp.Then sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the salt solution on the oil. For a more salty taste you can sprinkle 2 teaspoons salt water. But be careful when doing this as the oil sizzles and splutters a lot.As soon as the oil bubbles and sizzles, quickly cover the kadai with a splatter screen or mesh screen (if you have one) or else skip. With the splatter screen the oil does not splutter outside.After adding the salt solution, continue to fry until the sizzling and bubbling sound stops.The banana chips will be completely crispy and when you move them towards the side of the pan, you will hear a crispy sound.With a large slotted spoon, remove the banana chips draining the extra oil in the kadai.Place the chips in a large mesh strainer which is placed below a pan or bowl. This helps in draining the extra oil if any.Alternatively you can also place the fried banana wafers on kitchen paper towels. This way fry the banana chips in batches. While frying the later batches, if the chips taste too salty, then you can opt to add ½ teaspoon of the salt solution to the hot oil.As soon as the banana wafers cool down at room temperature, place them in a jar.

Cover with a lid and let the batter ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more.Depending on the temperature conditions in your city you can keep for less or more time.The batter after being fermented should have a faint sour aroma with tiny air pockets in it. Just lightly mix or stir the batter before making dosa.Making sabudana dosaNow heat a well seasoned cast iron skillet or nonstick pan. The pan should be medium hot. You can keep the flame to a low or medium while making sabudana dosa.If using an iron skillet, then spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan. Use a silicon brush or spoon or kitchen towel or an onion halve to spread the oil. Do not spread oil on a nonstick pan. Do keep the heat to a low or medium-low, so that you are easily able to spread the batter.If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium. If the pan is very hot, you won’t be able to spread the batter in a round circle.Pour a ladle of the batter in the center.With the ladle gently spread the batter to a neat round circle and a slightly thick dosa. You can even make thin dosa if you prefer.Sabudana dosa take a longer time to cook than regular dosa. Do cook the dosas on a low to medium heat.Cover the sabudana dosa with a lid and cook it for some minutes.When the top looks cooked, you can spread some oil on it. You need to cook these sabudana dosas on one side only.Cook till the base turn golden.When the base has turned golden, remove and serve sabudana dosa. The leftover batter can be refrigerated.Serve sabudana dosa hot or warm with coconut chutney, tomato chutney or peanut chutney.",NutritionCalories: 339kcal | Carbohydrates: 55g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 10g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.4g | Monounsaturated Fat: 8g | Sodium: 245mg | Potassium: 61mg | Fiber: 6g | Sugar: 0.04g | Vitamin A: 3IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.03mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.03mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin C: 2mg | Vitamin E: 4mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 32mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 4µg | Iron: 3mg | Magnesium: 17mg | Phosphorus: 45mg | Zinc: 0.5mg

Then place them in a clean plate or kitchen towel and let them dry naturally at room temperature. You can even wipe dry them very well with a clean kitchen cotton towel or napkin.Before beginning with the recipe making, do make sure that your hands, chopping board, knife, kitchen towels, bowls, spoons and jar are clean and moisture free. Later take each lemon and cut four sides but keeping the lemon intact and whole. Do not cut through completely. Cut all lemons this way.Squeeze a bit of juice – about ¼ to ½ teaspoons from each lemon piece into a bowl. But do not squeeze the lemons too much – you want them to keep their shape and fullness. Set the bowl of lemon juice aside to use later. Adding some lemon juice helps to preserve the pickle.If the seeds drop when you squeeze the juice, then remove them with a small spoon and discard. If the seeds remain in the lemon, then simply let them be. No need to remove them. Making spice mixIn another plate or bowl, take 1 tablespoon carom seeds (ajwain), ½ tablespoon red chili powder and 1 tablespoon salt.Mix very well and set aside.Stuffing the mixed spicesNow with your fingers or a small spoon stuff this spice mix in each lemon. Set aside.Place the lemons in a clean glass jar. You can sun dry the empty jar for 1 to 2 hours if you want.Now remove the seeds and pour the lemon juice which was in the bowl in the jar.Add leftover spice mix if any on the stuffed lemons in the jar.Sprinkle some salt (about ½ to 1 teaspoon) all over the lemons. This is essential so that the lemons don't spoil during the pickling process.Cover with a lid and keep the jar in sunlight for 4 days. Every day shake the jar. The tangy lemon pickle will be ready after 4 to 5 days and then you can serve it with your meals.StorageStore the lemon pickle in an air-tight jar in your refrigerator. Do not keep it at room temperature. When you want to serve, remove it with a clean dry spoon. Close the lid of the jar and keep it back in the refrigerator.

You can cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker or in a pan on the stovetop or the Instant pot adding water as needed.To pressure cook, take the rinsed potatoes in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Add water almost covering the potatoes.Pressure cook for 3 to 4 whistles on medium heat. When the pressure drops on its own in the cooker, then only remove the lid. The potatoes should be fork tender and softened.Remove the potatoes with the help of tongs and set aside to cool.When the potatoes become warm, peel and mash them very well with a vegetable masher. Let the mashed potatoes cool.Making aloo bhujia doughMeanwhile heat a small frying pan and add 16 to 18 mint leaves. You can rinse the mint leaves and then add.On a low heat stir and roast the leaves till they wilt and become crisp. Remove and crush the mint leaves in a mortar-pestle to a fine powder. Keep aside.

Mix very well.Now sieve the besan or gram flour directly over the potato mixture.Gently mix and start forming a dough. There is no need to add any water while kneading the dough. The moisture from the potato is enough for binding the dough. Or else the dough will become very sticky if you add water.The dough is slightly sticky. Cover the dough and keep aside.For making aloo bhujia, you need to use the disc with small fine holes. Grease the top of the this disc with some oil.Rub a bit of oil in your hands.

If the dough comes up gradually, then the oil is ready. If the dough sits at the bottom, the oil is still cold. If the piece of dough comes up briskly and quickly, the oil is too hot.When the oil is ready and is medium hot, take the sev maker and press it to extrude the dough strands directly in the oil. Move in rounds so that the aloo sev is evenly distributed in the oil. Be careful when doing this as the oil will be hot.The oil will start sizzling as soon as the sev comes in contact with it.When one side firms up, looks crisp, gently turn over with a strainer spoon or spider spoon and fry the other side.Keep on frying aloo bhujia sev till the sizzling reduces in the oil and the color of the potato sev changes to golden. Do turn over a couple of times, to get an even color.With a large strainer spoon, remove the fried aloo sev from the oil. Drain the excess oil back in the pan, by shaking the spoon.Place the fried aloo sev on kitchen paper towels to absorb extra oil.When they are still warm, to make them more chatpata, sprinkle ½ to 1 teaspoon of chaat masala on them.

Then spread the lentils on a plate or tray and let them dry naturally or in the sun. If keeping in the sun for a few hours, then you don't need to roast urad dal.Roast urad dal on a low flame for about 2 minutes, stirring often. Urad dal is roasted just to get rid of some moisture from them.Switch off the heat and then add ¼ teaspoon methi seeds. Mix well.Keep the pan on the kitchen countertop. Also let this mixture cool completely. You can also cool this mixture on a separate plate.In a mixing bowl take 3 cups idli rava. Keep aside.In a grinder jar add the urad dal and methi seeds.Grind to a fine flour.Using a sieve, sift the flour directly in the rice rava bowl. Some urad dal grits will be there on the sieve. You can add them to your lentil recipes or discard.Add ¼ cup gram flour.Next add 1 teaspoon salt. You can add more salt if required. I have added less salt.Mix very well with a spoon or a wired whisk.Then spoon the dosa mix flour in a jar. Seal tightly with its lid. Keep in a dry and cool place. You can also freeze or refrigerate the dosa mix. Use the instant dosa mix to make crispy dosas when required.Making instant dosa with 1 cup of this dosa mixTake 1 cup of dosa mix flour in a mixing bowl.Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice or ¼ cup sour curd (sour yogurt). Then add 1.25 to 1.3 cups water or add as required. Mix very well.The batter consistency is medium thick and flowing like dosa batter consistency.Next add ½ teaspoon fruit salt or eno evenly all over the batter. Again mix very well.Then make instant dosa on tawa or a flat skillet. Keep the heat to a low, so that you can easily spread the dosa batter. On a medium to high heat, it becomes difficult to spread the batter.Heat a tawa or a flat skillet on a low flame or sim. Take a ladle full of the batter. Gently spread it on the tawa to a neat and round dosa.Cover with a lid and let the dosa cook.Let the top side get cooked first. Then spread some oil or ghee or butter on the dosa.Continue to cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp. Flip dosa with a spatula and cook the other side.Flip and then fold dosa and serve. Prepare all the instant dosa this way. Remember to reduce the heat when spreading the dosa batter. Serve Instant Dosa hot with coconut chutney, sambar and potato masala. Make sure to serve the instant dosa hot as on cooling the crispy texture goes away.",

Use any regular rice. I used sona masuri rice.Then pressure cook the rice with 2 cups water, ¼ teaspoon salt for 3 to 4 whistles on a medium heat or for 11 to 12 minutes. You can also cook the rice in a pot. If cooking in a pot or pan, then you may need to add more water.Soak ½ tablespoon tightly packed tamarind in ¼ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.Later squeeze the soaked tamarind in the water to get the tamarind pulp. Strain and keep aside.When the pressure settles down on its own, open the cooker’s lid and fluff the rice. You can allow the rice to cool in the cooker itself or spread rice on a large plate/thali or tray. Let the cooked rice grains become warm or cool down. Cover and keep so that the rice grains do not dry out.When the rice is cooking, rinse the brinjals. Remove the crowns of the brinjals and slice them vertically in 4 long pieces. As soon as you chop them, place them in a bowl containing water to which some salt has been added. Do make sure that there is sufficient water covering the brinjals. Allow them to be in the salted water for 15 to 20 minutes.Making vangi bathHeat the peanut oil (can also use sesame oil or sunflower oil) in a pan or kadai.Add mustard seeds.Once the mustard seeds begin to crackle, then add ½ teaspoon urad dal.Next add 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts or cashews.Sauté until the urad dal becomes golden.Then add red chilies, curry leaves and asafoetida.Add the eggplants or brinjals.

If the masala along with brinjals start sticking to pan, then add ¼ cup water and continue to cook.Once the brinjals are cooked well and tender, add 2 tablespoons grated coconut and ¼ to ½ teaspoon jaggery powder.Mix again very well. The brinjal masala is thick. But for some moisture you can have a semi gravy consistency in the brinjal masala.Keep the pan down and add rice in two to three parts.

You can choose to add ½ to 1 teaspoon red chili powder and ½ teaspoon cumin powder instead of dry red chili and cumin seeds.Grind to a fine powder and set aside.Take a plate, pan or a large mixing bowl. Place a sieve on top of it. Add gram flour and rice flour.Then add the ground roasted chana dal, salt and asafoetida. Sift the whole mixture.Next add white sesame seeds to the mixture and set aside. In a small pan or a bowl heat 2 tablespoons butter or oil. I have used salted butter, but you can even use unsalted butter.Heat till all the butter melts. Now add the hot melted butter in the flour mixture.With a spoon or spatula mix the butter with the flour. Mix very well. Check the taste and if required you can add some more salt.Now add ⅓ cup water in parts and begin to knead the flour mixture. Knead to a smooth and non-sticky dough. Cover and set aside. If the dough looks dry then you can add some more water. If it becomes sticky then add some more gram flour. Frying ribbon pakodaUse the nozzle shown in the below picture for preparing ribbon pakoda. This one has serrated edges. You can even use the plain one without the serrated edges. Also heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying ribbon pakoda. Apply some water or oil in the chakli/murukku maker. Then take a portion of the dough and place it inside the murukku maker. Cover and seal with the top part and keep aside.Let the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough. If the dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the murukku maker on top of the oil and let the ribbon murukku directly fall in the oil.While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards on top of the kadai or pan. Do not over crowd the kadai with ribbon pakoda. Add as needed without overcrowding the kadai.After adding the murukku, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.Fry till they have become light golden.Turn over the ribbon pakoda gently with a slotted spoon, so that they get fried evenly.Now fry this side also till it becomes light golden.Turn over a couple of times for even frying. Fry till they are crisp and golden.When the oil stops sizzling it means the pakoda are fried. Then remove them with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon. Do not over brown or else the pakora becomes slightly dense. Also do not fry at low heat or low flame or else the pakora absorbs too much oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining pakoda in the same way.When they are cooled, then place them in an air-tight container or box.Serve ribbon pakoda as a diwali snack or a tea time snack.",NutritionCalories: 340kcal | Carbohydrates: 37g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 18g | Saturated Fat: 5g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 15mg | Sodium: 640mg | Potassium: 112mg | Fiber: 7g | Sugar: 2g | Vitamin A: 208IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 4mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 45mg | Iron: 4mg | Magnesium: 9mg | Phosphorus: 23mg | Zinc: 1mg

This nutty and mild rice based dish is also known as Thengai Sadam in Tamil language. The recipe is vegan and for a gluten-free version, easily skip adding asafetida.",30minutes,10minutes,40minutes,3,,Main Course,South Indian,Vegan,For cooking rice▢ 1 cup basmati rice or any regular non-sticky rice – or about 4 to 4.5 cups of cooked rice▢ 1.75 to 2 cups water,"PreparationSoak 1 cup regular rice or basmati rice in enough water for 20 to 30 minutes.Also soak the urad dal and chana dal in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. Later drain the water very well and set the lentils aside.Grate half of a medium to large coconut and keep aside. You need about 1.5 cups of tightly packed finely grated coconut.Cooking riceAfter 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and pressure cook the rice with 1.75 to 2 cups water for 2 whistles or 5 to 6 minutes on medium to medium-high heat in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker.If you do not have a pressure cooker, cook rice in a pot or pan or the Instant Pot. Find the details below.Cooking in a pot or pan: Take the soaked rice and 2 cups of water in a pan. Cover and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until rice grains are tender and the water has been absorbed. If the most of the water has evaporated and the rice grains look undercooked, add a few tablespoons of hot water. Cover and continue to cook rice.Cooking in Instant Pot: Transfer the rice grains and 1.5 cups water in the Instant Pot. Seal the lid and position the valve to sealing. Pressure cook on high pressure for 4 to 5 minutes. When the cooking is complete and you hear the beep sound, wait for 5 minutes before giving a quick pressure release. Open the lid and transfer the rice to a tray or plate for cooling.When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and fluff the rice. For a softer texture in the rice, pressure cook for 3 whistlesTake the rice in a plate/tray and allow to cool grains completely. You can also cool the rice in the cooker itself. If there are lumps in the rice, then break the lumps once the rice is cooled.Making temperingHeat coconut oil in a pan. You can also use sesame oil or any other neutral oil. Reduce the heat to a low. Crackle mustard seeds first in the hot oil. Add the chana dal and urad dal. Stir and fry for about a minute.Then add chopped cashews.Stir and fry till the cashews turn golden. The lentils would also turn golden by then.Add red chilies, curry leaves and chopped green chilies along with a pinch of asafetida.Stir and fry until the red chilies change color and the curry leaves become crisp.Making coconut riceNext add grated coconut. Mix very well.Sauté the coconut for 3 to 4 minutes stirring often. The coconut can be sautéed until it get a cream-ish color or a faint light beige color.Lastly add the steamed rice and salt.Combine and mix the rice well. Switch off the heat.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe coconut rice hot or warm. If you like you can garnish with chopped coriander leaves and drizzling with a bit of ghee while serving. You can also choose to drizzle some lemon juice on the rice while eating.You can serve coconut rice as is or pair with a gravy or curry like vegetable stew, potato roast, vegetable kurma, cauliflower kurma, potato curry or moong lentils curry or a simple dal and even plain homemade fresh curd or yogurt. I suggest pairing with gravy or curry for a really flavorful meal. Accompany some papadum (appalam) if you like.Since this rice has coconut, it is best had fresh. I do not recommend to store this rice in the fridge as the chances of coconut going rancid are very high. Moreover it is best to eat rice when freshly cooked.

Also add 1/2 cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal.Grind the urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula.Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. I ground in one batch and added 1 cup water for grinding. You can even add 3/4 cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rawa like consistency.Now pour the batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.Add 1/2 teaspoon rock salt or add as per taste.Mix the salt very well with the batter.

You can keep batter to ferment for less or more time and this will depend with the temperature conditions in your city.I kept for about 13 hours and 35 minutes as it is cold during monsoons here.Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter.making ghee roast dosaNow heat a thick bottomed cast iron griddle or non stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. You can keep the flame to a low or medium while making dosas. If using an iron pan, then spread ¼ to ½ tsp oil/ghee all over the pan. Use a silicon brush or spoon or kitchen towel or an onion halve to spread the oil/ghee. Do not spread oil/ghee on a non stick pan. Do keep the flame on low to low-medium flame, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium. Pour a ladle of the batter in the center.With the ladle gently spread the batter to get a neat round shape and a thin dosa.If the pan is very hot, you won’t be able to spread the batter in a round circle. So for a nonstick pan, just lift the pan from the flame and keep outside for some seconds or half a minute. Then again place it on the fire. For a iron griddle, you can sprinkle some water on the pan. This reduces the temperature of the cast iron griddle. Please do not sprinkle water on non stick pan. The non stick coating can wear off.On a medium flame, cook the dosa.When the top looks cooked, sprinkle 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ghee at the sides and on the top of dosa. You can add less or more ghee as per your requirements.Now with the spoon spread the ghee all over.Keep cooking till you see the base becoming golden.The more the base becomes golden, the dosa becomes more crisp.Fold and serve ghee roast dosa hot.Ghee roast dosa can be served with coconut chutney or a combination of coconut chutney and sambar.",

Keep the heat to its lowest and add urad dal.Begin to roast urad dal and keep stirring often when roasting the lentils.Roast urad dal till they become aromatic or are light golden. Do not make them brown. Remove in a plate and let the roasted urad dal cool at room temperature.Take the roasted urad dal in a small dry grinder jar or a small chutney grinder jar. Grind to a fine flour. Keep aside.Meanwhile, spread oil on the murukku disc. Also spread some oil on the part of the murukku maker where the dough will be placed.Making murukku doughIn a fine sieve, take rice flour. Also add the urad dal flour to the same sieve.Next add red chilli powder, asafoetida powder and salt. Sift the dry ingredients twice.To the sifted flours add sesame seeds, carom seeds and ghee.Mix everything very well. Then with your fingertips mix the ghee in the flour evenly. The mixture should resemble breadcrumbs.Hold a small portion of the murukku mixture in your palms and it should hold itself together. It should not break or fall apart. If it breaks or falls apart, then add 1 to 2 teaspoons more of the ghee. Mix again very well and then check.Now add water in parts and begin to mix and knead.Keep on adding water in parts and knead very well.You will need about 10 to 11 tablespoons of water. The amount of water needed will depend on the quality of rice flour. Check the taste of dough and add more salt if required.Knead to a smooth and soft dough. Also keep the dough slightly moist, but do not make too moist or wet as then the murukku absorbs more oil.Murukku has to be made as soon as you knead the dough, so keep everything ready before you shape and fry them.Shaping murukkuNow divide the dough in two parts and add first part in murukku maker. Cover the second part of dough with a kitchen towel.Before you begin to shape the murukku, keep oil in a kadai (wok) or frying pan to get heated. Keep the oil on a low or medium-low heat, so that it does not become very hot. Use any neutral flavored oil with a high smoke point.Use butter paper or parchment paper squares. Cut them in squares and keep ready before you make murukku. Press the murukku maker and move in rounds to get the concentric circles or spiral shape on the paper squares. Break the dough towards the end and press it to the last concentric circle of the spiral.Tip 1 – If the murukku breaks while forming them, this means that the dough does not have enough moisture. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water and knead the dough again.Tip 2 – If you are not getting proper shape, this mean that the dough is too moist. Add some rice flour and knead again.Make a batch of murukku. E.g make 3 to 5 murukku that you will be frying at a time.Frying murukkuNext test the hotness of the oil. Add a small piece of the murukku dough in the oil and it should come up gradually. If it comes up fast, the oil is hot, so reduce the heat. If it sticks or is at the bottom or comes up slowly, the oil is not hot enough, so increase the heat.Take the butter paper with the murukku in your hands. Then take a small to medium sized wooden spatula and place it on the murukku gently.Then gently turn over the spatula. The butter paper will be facing you. Lift the butter paper gently.The murukku will be neatly placed on the wooden spatula.Now gently tilt or place the spatula in oil, so that the murukku slides in the oil.Add the remaining murukku also in this manner. Fry on a medium heat.When they turn light golden, then flip them gently. Fry the second side. Fry the murukku till the oil stops sizzling or till they become crisp and golden. Do not brown them too much. Turn over as needed for even frying.Tip 3 – Check the first batch of murukku. If it looks like that the murukku has absorbed oil or breaks in oil, then add some rice flour, about 1 to 2 tablespoons and knead again. This happens if too much fat has gone in the dough.Remove with a slotted spoon draining extra oil in the kadai or pan itself.Place them on kitchen paper towels to soak extra oil.Once they cool at room temperature, then store murukku in an air-tight box at room temperature.Serve Murukku as a tea-time snack.",NutritionCalories: 49kcal | Carbohydrates: 5g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 3g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 2mg | Sodium: 37mg | Potassium: 5mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 2mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 2mg | Phosphorus: 5mg | Zinc: 1mg

Thattai are made with rice flour, spices and herbs having a spiced, crunchy and crispy taste.",20minutes,20minutes,40minutes,25,Thattai,Snacks,"South Indian, Tamil Nadu",Vegetarian,for roasting▢ 1 tablespoon urad dal – 10 to 11 grams▢ 1 cup Rice Flour – 160 grams,"PreparationFirstly rinse and then soak chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes.Heat a heavy kadai or pan. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. Add urad dal (husked and whole or split black gram).Lightly roast urad dal for 1 to 2 minutes. Urad dal need not be browned. Remove and set aside.In the same kadai or pan, add rice flour. On a low to medium-low heat stirring often, roast the rice flour till it becomes warm to touch.Remove and set aside in a mixing bowl.In a small grinder, take the roasted urad dal. Also add roasted chana dal. Roasted chana dal can be skipped too if you do not have it.Grind to a fine powder.Making thattai doughIn the bowl containing the rice flour add the ground lentil flours.Add chopped curry leaves, asafoetida powder, red chilli powder, white sesame seeds and salt. You can even add freshly grated coconut or thinly sliced fresh coconut (optional).Mix the salt, spices and herbs with the flours evenly.Now sprinkle 2 tablespoons water and add 1 tablespoon butter or ghee in the flour mixture. You can add opt to add ghee instead of butter. The butter can be cold or at room temperature. With your fingertips mix the butter with the flour. Mix thoroughly. Add 3 tablespoons water.Gently mix and start bringing the mixture together.Drain all the water and then add the soaked chana dal to the dough mix.Mix and then knead to a semi-soft dough. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons more water or as required while kneading the dough. I added about a total of 9.5 tablespoons of water. Addition of water will depend on the texture and quality of rice flour. So add in portions.Tip – avoid making a soft dough as then it becomes difficult to shape and lift the thattai rounds. Do not make the dough too hard as then thattai will not be crisp. It will have a hard and dense texture. Also check the taste of dough and add more salt if needed. Cover and keep aside.Assembling and Shaping thattaiTake a butter paper or parchment paper or a ziplock bag or a clean cotton napkin. Grease the butter paper or parchment paper with some oil. Keep oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Keep the heat to medium or medium-high.Make small balls from the dough.Place a dough ball on the greased parchment paper.Press and flatten thattai with your fingertips to a thin round. Spread some oil on your fingers while flattening them. Do not make them too thin and flat as then you cannot lift them.Make 5 to 6 thattai on the parchment paper. Check the temperature of oil by adding a tiny piece of the thattai dough. If it comes up swiftly on top, the oil is hot enough.Frying thattaiLift the prepared thattai round gently from the paper.Gently place in the hot oil.Begin to fry thattai on a medium or medium-high heat. When one side is crisp, then flip over each thattai with a slotted or spider spoon.Fry the second side till crisp. You can flip a couple of times to get an even golden color and crispness.Fry thattai till crispy and crunchy. When the oil stops bubbling and sizzling, this means the thattai is fried well.Remove fried thattai with a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper towels.When frying the first batch of thattai, shape the second batch and keep them ready. However do keep an eye on the batch of the thattai that is being fried. This way make all thattai in batches.As soon as the thattai cools at room temperature, place them in a steel box or jar. Serve thattai to the deities. If making as an evening snack, then serve with chai or filter coffee.",NutritionCalories: 46kcal | Carbohydrates: 6g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 2g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 52mg | Potassium: 11mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 71IU | Vitamin C: 24mg | Calcium: 7mg | Iron: 1mg

Use a silicon brush or spoon or kitchen towel or an onion halve to spread the oil. Do not spread oil on a non stick pan.Do keep the heat on low to low-medium, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium. If the pan is very hot, you won’t be able to spread the batter in a round circle.Pour a ladle of the batter in the center and with the ladle itself, gently spread the batter to a neat round circle and a slightly thick dosa.These dosas are not thin and slightly thick. You can even make uttapams with the vendhaya dosa batter.Cover the dosa with a lid and cook it for some minutes.When the top looks cooked, you can spread some oil on it. You need to cook these dosas on one side only.When the base has turned golden, remove and serve. Prepare all methi dosas this way. The leftover batter can be refrigerated and you can make uttapams the next day or day after.Serve Vendhaya Dosa hot or warm with kara chutney, tomato chutney or onion chutney.",NutritionCalories: 331kcal | Carbohydrates: 50g | Protein: 8g | Fat: 11g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 9g | Sodium: 156mg | Potassium: 100mg | Fiber: 5g | Vitamin A: 3IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.3mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.04mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 4mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 23mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 129µg | Iron: 4mg | Magnesium: 23mg | Phosphorus: 68mg | Zinc: 1mg

It is also called as Omapodi Mixture.",15minutes,1hour,1hour,350,grams,Snacks,"South Indian, Tamil Nadu",Vegetarian,"For omapodi▢ 1  teaspoon  carom seeds (ajwain, omam)▢ 1  cup gram flour (besan) – 120 grams▢ ½  cup  Rice Flour or 100 grams▢ 1  generous pinch asafoetida (hing)▢ 2  pinches turmeric powder – optional▢ ¼  teaspoon  Red Chilli Powder▢ 1  teaspoon  salt  or add as required▢ 1  tablespoon  oil  or ghee or butter▢ 6 to 7  tablespoons  water  or add as required▢ oil  as required for deep frying","Making omapodiPreparing omapodi doughHeat a small pan and keep flame to a low. Add 1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds).Stirring often roast ajwain for some seconds till they are aromatic. No need to brown them. Let them cool down.Then add them in a small dry grinder jar or a spice grinder.Grind to a fine powder. Keep aside. You can even crush ajwain in a mortar-pestle. In this case, when adding ajwain, use a tea strainer and sift the ajwain powder through it. This is done so that when pressing through the sev maker, the dough strands do not break.In a mixing bowl or pan take 1 cup besan (gram flour) and ½ cup rice flour.Add the ground ajwain powder.Then add 1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing), 2 pinches turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder and 1 teaspoon salt. You can add salt as per taste. Turmeric powder can be skipped. For a spicy omapodi, you can increase the amount of red chilli powder. For more crispiness you can add a pinch of baking soda also.Mix very well with a spoon or spatula.Now heat 1 tablespoon oil in a steel bowl or a steel measuring cup.When the oil becomes hot, add it to the flour mixture. Instead of oil you can also use ghee or butter.Now add water in parts. First add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water. Mix well and begin to knead to a smooth dough. Overall I used 7 tablespoons of water. You can add 6 to 7 tablespoons of water depending on the quality of besan and rice flour.Knead to a smooth dough. If the dough becomes sticky, then you can add some more besan. If the dough looks dry, then add some more water and knead again. Cover the bowl and set aside.Use the disc to make sev or omapodi and assemble the sev press or murukku press. You can even use the disc with fine holes. Also heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying omapodi.Apply some water or oil in the sev/murukku maker. Then take a portion of the omapodi dough and place it inside the sev maker. Cover with the top part and keep aside.Frying omapodiLet the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small tiny piece of the omapodi dough. If the small piece of dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough for frying.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the sev maker on top of the oil and let the sev directly fall in the oil. While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a chakli. Do not over crowd the kadai with omapodi. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai. Be careful when pressing the dough in the oil. After the omapodi is pressed in the oil, break the top strands with a spoon or knife and let the dough strands fall in the oil.After adding the omapodi, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first for a minute. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.Gently begin to turn with a slotted spoon.Now fry the second side. You can turn over a couple of times for even frying.When the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry for some more seconds till the omapodi are golden and crisp. Turn over as needed when frying. Do not break the omapodi while frying as then it becomes extra work to remove the small pieces of omapodi from the oil. So fry the entire round shaped omapodi as one piece and do not break it.Once done then remove omapodi with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon draining off the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining omapodi in the same way.When the omapodi are cooled, then place them in an air tight container or box. Break omapodi before adding in the mixture. Making BoondiPreparing boondi batterTake ½ cup besan (gram flour) and 1 tablespoon rice flour in a mixing bowl.Then add 1 pinch asafoetida (hing), 1 pinch of baking soda, 2 pinches turmeric powder and ½ teaspoon salt.Mix everything with a spoon.Now add 8 to 9 tablespoons water in parts.Using a wired whisk make a smooth and slightly thin batter without lumps.The batter consistency is slightly thin. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of gram flour. So add accordingly.frying boondiHeat oil for frying in a kadai or pan. When the oil becomes hot, then tap the wired whisk or the handle of a spoon which has a bit of batter in to the hot oil.Now take a dry perforated ladle/jhara and place it above the hot oil. Don't keep too much on a height, as the batter droplets, when falling from a height, do not give a round shape. With a spoon add some batter on the perforated spoon ladle/jhara. Spread the batter lightly with a spoon. Finish up the batter on the perforated spoon ladle this way.On a medium flame heat to fry the boondi. Do not turn them. Let them become slightly crisp and then turn them.When the boondi have become crisp, turn them with a slotted spoon.After the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry the boondi for some more seconds so that they become crisp.Remove with a strainer spoon or a slotted spoon draining the extra oil.Place the fried salted boondi on kitchen paper towels.After each batch, wipe the perforated ladle/jhara with a clean piece of moist thin cotton kitchen towel from both sides. Continue to fry boondi this way. Once the boondi cools at room temparature, store in an air tight jar or box.When the boondi are frying you can remove the other ingredients and keep everything ready for the next step.Frying nutsUse a fine sieve ladle with a handle to fry as shown in the stepwise photos in the post. Heat oil on medium heat. Take the peanuts first in the sieve. Immerse in the oil and begin to fry.With a spoon stir often while frying so that the peanuts are fried evenly.Fry peanuts till they are crisp and crunchy.Using the same seive drain the extra oil. So this ladle is helpful for frying as well as for getting rid of extra oil after frying.Place the fried peanuts on kitchen paper towel.Then take cashews in the same ladle.Stirring often with a spoon fry cashews till they are golden.Place the fried cashews on the same kitchen paper towel.Next take roasted chana dal.Stirring often with a spoon fry roasted chana dal till they are crisp.Frying chana dal will take some seconds and their color will change.Place the fried chana dal on the same kitchen paper towel.Now take thick poha.Stirring often with a spoon fry poha till they are crisp and pale golden. Don't brown the poha.Once the poha is fried well, then drain off the extra oil using the same ladle.Place the fried poha on the same kitchen paper towel.Next add curry leaves. stirring often fry curry leaves till they become crisp.Curry leaves take a few seconds to fry. Place the fried curry leaves on the kitchen paper towel.Making Madras MixtureIn a large bowl or tray or plate take 2 cups of the omapodi and 2 cups of fried boondi. The remaining omapodi you can serve as a snack. With the remaining boondi, you can make boondi raita. You can also take more of the omapodi or boondi if you prefer.Add the fried nuts, poha, chana dal, curry leaves.Add ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, ⅛ teaspoon asafoetida (hing) and salt over the fried chana dal, poha, nuts and curry leaves as they will be still hot.Mix well with a spoon first and then later you can mix with your hands.Then place the mixture in a jar or container.

Add 1 teaspoon carom seeds.Stirring often roast carom seeds for some seconds till they are aromatic. No need to brown them. Set aside and let them cool.When cooled, add them in a small dry grinder jar or a spice grinder.Grind to a fine powder. Set aside.Making omapodi doughIn a mixing bowl or pan take gram flour and rice flour.Add the ground carom seeds powder.Then add asafoetida (hing), turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt. You can add salt as per taste. Turmeric powder can be omitted. For a spicier omapodi, you can increase the quantity of red chilli powder.Mix very well with a spoon or spatula. Next heat 1 tablespoon oil in a steel bowl or a steel measuring cup.When the oil becomes hot, add it to the flour mixture. Instead of oil you can also use ghee or butter.Mix oil with the flour mixture with a spoon or spatula.Next add water in portions. First add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water. Mix well and begin to knead to a smooth dough. Overall I added 7 tablespoons of water. You can add 6 to 7 tablespoons of water depending on the quality of gram flour and rice flour.Knead to a smooth dough. If the omapodi dough becomes sticky, then you can add some more besan. If the dough looks dry, then add some more water and knead again. Cover the bowl.Frying omapodiFrom the sev press or murukku press, take the disc that is used to make omapodi. You can even use the disc with fine holes. Heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying omapodi.Apply some water or oil in the sev press or murukku maker. Then take a portion of the omapodi dough and place it inside the sev maker. Cover with the top part and keep aside.Let the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small tiny piece of the omapodi dough. If the small piece of dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough for frying omapodi.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the sev maker on top of the oil and let the dough strands directly fall in the oil. While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a chakli. Do not over crowd the kadai with the dough strands. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai. Be careful when pressing the sev in the oil.After the dough strands are pressed in the oil, break the top sev strands with a spoon or knife and let the dough strands fall in the oil.After adding the dough strands in the oil, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first for a minute. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.Gently begin to turn with a slotted spoon. Now fry the second side.You can turn over a couple of times for even frying.When the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry for some more seconds till the omapodi are golden and crisp. Turn over as needed when frying.Once done then remove with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon draining off the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining omapodi in the same way in batches.When they are cooled, then place them in an air tight container or box.Serve omapodi as a diwali snack or a tea time snack.",NutritionCalories: 352kcal | Carbohydrates: 41g | Protein: 9g | Fat: 17g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 800mg | Potassium: 296mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 50IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 6mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 1mg | Iron: 9mg | Magnesium: 9mg | Phosphorus: 26mg | Zinc: 1mg

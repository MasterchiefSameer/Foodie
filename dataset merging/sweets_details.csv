Use cashews that are at room temperature and not refrigerated ones.Grind the kaju to a smooth and fine powder, but make sure you don't over do the grinding process as fat should not release from the cashews. Remember to grind in short intervals. The cashews should be in powder form and not become pasty or buttery like cashew butter. If there are tiny pieces in the cashew powder, then just let them be. Or opt to sieve the cashew powder and set aside. Use a medium fine sieve and not a fine one to sift the powdered cashews.Making Cashew DoughOn a low flame heat sugar and water in a thick bottomed or non stick pan or kadai.Meanwhile grease a plate or a tray and keep aside or keep butter papers ready.When all the sugar has dissolved in the water, add the cashew powder.

3,Rasgulla Recipe (Soft & Spongy),https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/rasgulla-recipe-2-280x280.jpg,"Rasgulla is a popular Bengali sweet and is also called as rosogolla. This traditional sweet is made with whole milk that is split or curdled to make Chenna, which is then shaped into balls and cooked in sugar syrup. This Bengali rasgulla recipe will guide you in making the perfect soft and spongy rasgulla.",30minutes,10minutes,40minutes,18,Rasgulla,Desserts,"Bengali, Indian","Gluten Free, Vegetarian",▢ 1 litre whole milk▢ 2 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice or add as required▢ 2 cups sugar or raw sugar▢ 1 litre water▢ 1 tablespoon milk – optional▢ 1 teaspoon sooji (rava or cream of wheat) or all purpose flour or cornstarch▢ 1 to 2 tablespoon rose water or kewra water or ½ teaspoon cardamom powder,"Making chennaTake whole milk in a pan and keep it to boil on a low to medium heat. So when the milk is heating up, line a strainer or bowl with a cheese cloth or muslin.Keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the froth is not formed on top and the base does not get browned or the milk solids get stuck to the bottom.When the milk comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to its lowest. Add 1 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice. First add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and stir. If the milk has not curdled completely, then add 1 tablespoon more. Keep the lemon juice handy with you.Depending on the quality of milk, you may need to add 1 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Stir after adding the lemon juice. Sometimes I have added 1 tablespoon lemon juice and the milk has curdled and sometimes I needed to add 3 tablespoons too. Vinegar also can be added instead of lemon juice. Another option is curd/yogurt. Add 4 to 5 tablespoons of yogurt or more if required. With yogurt you don't need to rinse the chenna in water later.As soon as the milk curdles, switch off the heat. The milk should curdle completely with the green watery whey. If the milk does not curdle, then add ½ to 1 tablespoon of lemon juice more.Now pour the curdled milk in the cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer or bowl.Gather the muslin from the sides and rinse the chenna or coagulated milk very well in running water. This brings down the temperature of chenna as well as removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the chenna.Now squeeze the muslin with your hands very well, so that excess water is drained from the chenna. Remember there should not be excess water or moisture in the chenna as then the rasgulla will break when cooking.Place a heavy weight on the chenna for 7 to 8 minutes. You can also hang the chenna for about 30 minutes.Making chenna ballsAfter 7 to 8 minutes, remove the cheesecloth from the chenna. Note that the chenna should not have too much moisture nor be too dry.Add 1 teaspoon sooji or rava or semolina. You can also add all purpose flour (maida). Adding either of them helps to bind the mixture. First mix the sooji with chenna and then begin to knead.With the heels of your palms mash the chenna and knead. Keep on collecting the chenna from the sides and continue to mash and knead. This kneading process is very important and also decides the texture of chenna. When you feel your palms becoming a bit greasy, its time to stop. Just a bit of greasiness is required.Avoid kneading to an extent where the whole chenna becomes greasy. I kneaded for about 10 minutes as I have very light hands. So depending on the quality of chenna and the pressure you apply while kneading, you can take more or less time. Note that the chenna should just begin to get greasy.Knead to a smooth ball of chenna.Now pinch small portions from the chenna and roll them between your palms to a smooth round ball.Prepare all small balls this way. Cover all the chenna balls with a moist muslin or kitchen towel and keep aside.Making sugar syrupIn a large pan, take 2 cups sugar and 4 cups water.You have to use a large pot or pan so that there is enough space for the rasgulla to cook and increase in size. You can also use a stovetop pressure cooker. I used a pot measuring 8.5 inches in diameter and 4.5 in height – a 3.4 litre stainless steel pot.Keep this pan on stovetop and heat the sugar solution. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. I kneaded the chenna and cooked the sugar syrup simultaneously. You can also do this way.Add 1 tablespoon milk and stir. Adding milk helps in removing impurities. If there are no impurities then you don't need to add milk and directly proceed to step 6.Once the sugar solution becomes hot, the impurities begin to float on the top.You can either remove it with a spoon. Or strain the impurities in a cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer.Now from the purified sugar solution, reserve ½ cup in a cup or mug. This ½ cup of sugar solution we will be adding to the cooking rasgulla.Reserve another 1 cup of the sugar solution in a serving bowl.Making rasgullaThe rest of the 2.5 cups of sugar solution you add it back to the same large pot and bring it to a boil on a medium high heat.Slid the rasgulla gently into the sugar solution.Once all the rasgulla have been added to the sugar solution, shake the pot. Don't stir the rasgulla with a spoon. Just gently shake the pot.Cover immediately with a lid and let them cook. Keep the heat to a medium or medium high.After 4 minutes, open the lid and add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Shake the pan. Adding this reserved sugar solution ensures that the temperature and consistency of the sugar solution is maintained and the sugar does not cook to its thread consistencies.Cover again and continue to cook.After 4 minutes, again add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Cover and again cook for 2 minutes. I cooked for 10 minutes. The timing will vary depending on the thickness & quality of pan, the depth of the pan and heat intensity.To check the donenessThere are two ways. First place the rasgulla in a bowl or cup of water. If the rasgulla sinks to the bottom its cooked. Second method is to press a small portion of the rasgulla with your finger. If the pressed portion bounces back to its original shape, its cookedOnce they are cooked, switch off the heat and keep the pan down on the countertop.Soaking in sugar syrupNow take each rasgulla with a spoon and place it in the bowl containing the 1 cup of sugar solution. Cover and keep aside.Let the sugar solution in which the rasgulla were cooked, become warm. Then add this to the serving bowl containing the rasgulla.Once the whole mixture has cooled down, add 1 to 2 tablelsoons rose water. If you don't have rose water you can also kewra water (pandanus extract) or ½ tsp cardamom powder. Stir gently and allow them to be soaked in the sugar syrup for 30 minutes.Serving & Storage SuggestionsYou can serve the rasgulla now or refrigerate them and serve later cold or chilled.When serving place the required amount of rasgulla in each serving bowl. Pour a few tablespoons of the sugar syrup in each serving bowl. If you prefer garnish rasgulla with some slivered almonds or pistachios. Keep them covered with the sugar syrup in an air-tight container. They keeps well for about a week in the refrigerator. Do not store them at room temperature.",NutritionCalories: 91kcal | Carbohydrates: 23g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 10mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 22g | Vitamin A: 2IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 6mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 1mg | Phosphorus: 2mg | Zinc: 1mg

Keep the sugar solution aside.)Making boondiMake a smooth flowing batter of the gram flour/besan, crushed saffron and water. The batter should neither be thick nor thin. It should be a flowing batter without any lumps. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of the the gram flour. So you can add more or less than what is mentioned in the recipe.Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil has to be moderately hot. Take a perforated ladle/spoon. With your hands position the ladle above the oil. You will need one more large ladle/jhara to remove the fried boondis.Take a large spoon of the besan batter and pour it on perforated ladle/spoon. Press with the other spoon so that the batter falls down from the perforations into the hot oil.Fry the boondi (gram flour balls) till they become golden. Don’t over fry or make them crisp. When the oil stops sizzling, remove the boondis. About 45 seconds to 1 minute is enough to get the correct texture in the boondi.This step is important because if boondi becomes crisp then motichur laddu won't be soft and they won't be able to absorb the sugar syrup.Making motichoor ladooFor collecting the fried boondi use a large slotted spoon/jhara. Drain the oil very well after removing the boondi and then add them directly to the sugar syrup. Also note that the sugar syrup should be hot.If the sugar syrup is not hot, then just heat it. In case, the sugar syrup crystallizes, then reheat again mixing 1 to 2 tablespoons water. No need to bother about the tailed or flat boondis as we will be pulsing them in the blender later.Make all the boondis like this and keep on adding them immediately to the sugar syrup. Stir and mix well. The boondis should get softened in the sugar syrup.In a blender or mixer add the boondi and the sugar syrup. Add 1 tablespoon of hot water and pulse the boondi mixture for a few times to get a smaller shape.Don't pulse too much otherwise you won't be able to shape the motichur laddu. The amount of water to be added depends on the texture of the boondis.If the boondis are a bit crisp, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons more of the hot water. The boondis absorb the hot water and remain soft and moist.Add the magaz/melon seeds and black cardamom seeds. Mix well.Apply some oil or ghee on your palms and shape the motichoor ladoo. The mixture would be warm when preparing the laddu. On cooling they become firm.You can garnish the motichoor ladoo with melon seeds/magaz or raisins. These motichur ladoo can also be refrigerated since they are not made from ghee. If you fry them in ghee then the ghee will solidify on refrigeration.",NutritionCalories: 173kcal | Carbohydrates: 27g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 6g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 3mg | Sodium: 10mg | Potassium: 112mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 21g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 10mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 52µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 22mg | Phosphorus: 39mg | Zinc: 1mg

Drain the water. Then remove the peels from the nuts.Slice or sliver or chop them and set aside.Cooking milk to half of its volumeTake whole milk in a thick bottomed kadai or pan and begun to heat the milk on a low to medium heat, till the milk starts to froth or form a layer of clotted cream (malai) on top. Stir a couple of time when the milk is getting heated.So when you will see the cream floating on top, then with a spatula, gently move the cream layer.Bring it towards the side of the pan and stick it to the pan. Keep the heat to a low and continue to simmer. Keep on simmering the milk like this and collecting the cream layer on the sides.This process of collecting the cream layer has to be done many times. continuous simmering of the milk will bring the cream on top and you have to bring and stick it to the sides of the pan.In between also stir the milk gently on occasions, so that the milk does not get burnt from the bottom. If you do too much of stirring and if quickly, then you won't get the layers of cream in the rabri. So after you have moved the layer of cream (malai) to the side of the pan, then stir the milk a few times. Then wait until another layer of cream forms on the surface of the milk. You can also just thicken and scrape the milk solids from the sides but in this case you won't get the layers of clotted cream or malai in the rabdi. Making rabdi recipeOnce the milk reduces to half, then add sugar. You can add sugar as per your taste preferences.Then add crushed saffron strands and cardamom powder. Stir gently.Continue collecting the cream and bringing it to the sides of the pan. Also do stir the milk gently after you bring the cream towards the sides of the pan. If you don't stir the milk then there is a possibility of the milk getting browned or burnt from the bottom.After adding saffron, the color will change gradually to a beautiful yellow color as the milk keeps on reducing.When the milk gets reduced to ⅓ or ¼ of its original quantity, then switch off the heat. It took me about 1 hour 15 minutes on a low heat initially and medium heat towards the latter stage. I cooked it until ⅓ of its original volume. The cream layer will be collected on the sides with a spatula. Scrape off the entire cream layer as well as dried milk solids and add into the thickened milk.Stir gently. Then add the sliced almonds, pistachios and 1 teaspoon rose water or kewra water. Stir gently again. Reserve a few of the blanched and slivered nuts for garnishServing and Storage SuggestionsGarnish with some of the blanched almond and pistachio slivers.

Mix the dry ingredients well.Add the khoya and curd (yogurt). Please use fresh yogurt. Instead of khoya you can also use milk powder.Add water and begin to stir to a thick or medium-thick flowing batter without lumps.Cover the bowl and allow the batter to rest for 30 minutes.Meanwhile when the batter is resting blanch the almonds and pistachios in hot water. Keep them soaked in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. Then peel and slice them. Keep aside.Making sugar syrupIn a pan take sugar and water. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. On a low heat simmer this mixture.You need to have a ½ string or 1 string consistency in the sugar syrup. If you cannot achieve these string consistencies than just make a sticky syrup.The sugar needs to be kept warm. For this keep the sugar syrup on a hot water bath so that it stays warm throughout and does not crystallize. Meaning you have to keep the sugar syrup pan on a bowl or another pan filled with hot water. The hot water should touch the base of the pan containing the sugar syrup.Making malpuaHeat ghee in a frying pan or skillet.When the ghee is heating up add baking soda to the batter.Stir to combine so that the baking soda is mixed evenly with the batter.Lower the heat.

Gently coat the malpua with the sugar syrup with a spoon or small tongs.Immediately remove them and place them in a serving tray or plate. Prepare all malpua this way and coat them with the sugar syrup.Pour some rabri on top. Garnish with the chopped almonds and pistachios. Serve the malpua with rabdi hot. You can also just serve them coated with the sugar syrup and garnished with the blanched nuts.Making rabri to serve with malpuaIn a broad thick bottomed pan or sauce pan or a kadai take the whole milk and bring it first to boil.Lower the heat and continue to simmer the milk stirring at intervals.Bring the clotted cream/malai which forms on top of the milk to the sides of the pan. Also keep on scraping the dried milk from the sides and add them back to the milk.Do stir often so that the milk does not get burned at the bottom of the pan. Keep on simmering, stirring, removing the clotted cream and scraping the cream of the sides. Switch off the heat when the milk has reduced to ⅓ or ¼ of its original volume. The milk would also have thickened. It will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour for the milk to thicken on a low heat.Add sugar. Stir well so that the sugar dissolves.Next add crushed saffron or saffron powder along with kewra water (pandanus water) or rose water.

Keep the sugar solution on stove top on a low heat.Cook the sugar syrup, till you get a one thread consistency. Stir often. Switch off the heat. Set the sugar solution aside.The sugar syrup should be hot when you add the boondi. So you can keep the sugar solution on a hot water bath by place the pan on a plate or tray filled with hot water. You can choose to fry the boondi and prepare the sugar solution side by side.Making and frying boondiTake the dry ingredients for the boondi batter in a mixing bowl – gram flour and crushed saffron or saffron powder.Add water to make a smooth batter. The consistency of the batter is important. We will check if the consistency is right, by frying a few boondis.Tap the wired whisk or the handle of a spoon which has a bit of batter in to the hot oil. The boondis should have a round shape.If they become flat, the batter is thin and if they get tail ends, the batter is thick.TIP 1: If thin, then add a bit of gram flour and check by frying a few boondi. TIP 2: If thick, then add a bit of water and then do the same test. Once you get the correct consistency, proceed with the next step of frying the boondi.Take a dry perforated ladle and place it above the hot oil. Don't keep the ladle too much on a height, as the batter droplets, when falling from a height, do not give a round shape.With a spoon add some batter on the perforated spoon ladle.Spread the batter lightly with a spoon. Finish up the batter on the perforated spoon ladle this way.Fry the boondi till they are cooked. Don't make them crisp or over do the frying. When the oil stops sizzling, remove the boondi.This step is also important because if boondi becomes crisp then the boondi ladoo won’t be soft and they won’t be able to absorb the sugar syrup.After each batch, wipe the perforated ladle with a clean piece of kitchen towel from both sides.Making Boondi LadduStrain the fried boondi well with a slotted spoon and then add them directly to the hot sugar syrup. Fry all the boondi in batches with the above method and then add them to the sugar syrup.Finally add melon seeds (magaz), cardamom powder, black cardamon seeds, ghee and a pinch of edible camphor (optional). Mix well and shape the boondi mixture into a small to medium-sized round spherical ball. If you are not able to shape them, then add 1 to 2 tablespoon more ghee as it helps in binding.You can place the boondi ladoo in a small muffin liners. You can also garnish them with raisins or cashews or slivered nuts like almonds or pistachios.Serve boondi laddu. If not serving the same day, refrigerate them in an airtight container.

If you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours and if you live in a hot or warm climate, keep for 6 to 10 hours. After fermentation the batter will have tiny air-pockets in it with a tangy taste. Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.With a spoon mix very well.Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.Preparing sugar syrupTake 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebi.Add ½ cup of water.Keep this pan on stove top on low heat and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the heat and add ¼ tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebi in it.Frying jalebiHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavor.To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebi to be fried. The frying temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit/176 degrees Celsius.Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.You won't get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.Some jalebi will be cooked faster than others.Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.Adding fried jalebi to sugar syrupThen immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes or more, they will have a deep color.Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature. The leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated.",NutritionCalories: 85kcal | Carbohydrates: 15g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 2g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Sodium: 15mg | Potassium: 17mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 10g | Vitamin A: 1IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 3mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 15µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 3mg | Phosphorus: 10mg | Zinc: 1mg

Mysore pak is made with only three ingredients – gram flour, ghee and sugar. It is rich, luxurious and melt in the mouth sweet.",5minutes,20minutes,25minutes,14,pieces,Sweets,Karnataka,"Gluten Free, Vegetarian",▢ 1.25 cups sugar – 200 to 210 grams▢ 1 cup gram flour (besan) – 100 grams▢ 1 cup Ghee (clarified butter) – 200 to 210 grams ghee▢ ½ cup water,"PreparationFirstly measure all the 3 ingredients and set aside – sugar, gram flour and ghee.Sieve the gram flour once or twice. This helps in reducing the lumps if any while mixing gram flour in the sugar syrup.Grease a pan or tray with some ghee. Use a pan or tray which can give you some depth and height, so that you can get rectangular or square pieces.Making sugar syrupNow take the sugar in a heavy thick bottomed kadai. Since a lot of stirring happens, I would suggest you to use a heavy and large aluminium or iron kadai. Please do not use non stick pan as due to the heat and lot of stirring, the non stick coating can get affected.Add ½ cup water in the sugar.Keep the pan on the stove top. On a medium-low or medium flame, heat the sugar syrup.Stir so that the sugar dissolves.Melting GheeMeanwhile also take the ghee in another pan and keep it on stove top. Let the ghee melt on a low flame or sim.The ghee has to be hot when we add it in the gram flour mixture. So let it be on a slow simmer.Adding Gram Flour to Sugar SyrupLet the sugar syrup start bubbling and boiling. We are not looking for one string consistency in the sugar syrup. Just let the sugar solution come to a boil and then add the gram flour.Add the gram flour in three to four portions. First add some of the gram flour.With a wired whisk, stir the gram flour briskly, so that it dissolves with the sugar solution.With one hand using a spoon, add the gram flour and with the other hand mix it with a wired whisk.Finish of all the gram flour this way.Stir very well, so that the gram flour has got mixed evenly with the sugar syrup. Adding GheeThen add ghee in parts. First add a ladle full of the hot ghee.You will see a lot of bubbles and frothing in the gram flour mixture after you add ghee.As soon as you add ghee, mix it with the gram flour with a spoon or spatula. Using a ladle, with one hand, add ghee and with the other hand mix it with a spatula.Then add the second portion of ghee and again mix it very well. Keep the heat to a medium-low or medium.This way finish off adding all the ghee in parts. Mix thoroughly.Do use a bigger kadai and also some gloves on your hands, as there is a lot of sizzling, frothing and bubbling that happens.Cooking Mysore Pak MixtureAll the ghee will be absorbed first and what you will see is a smooth molten gram flour mixture.On a medium-low to medium heat with non-stop stirring cook the gram flour mixture.You have to continue to cook and stir till you start seeing many bubbles in the mixture and the ghee is released from it. So continue to cook and stir. The mixture will also start to leave the sides of the kadai or pan. While stirring also scrape the bottom of the kadai and the sides. If you do not scrape, then the mixture starts sticking and gets browned or burnt.So you have to stir nonstop and scrape. Do use a flat steel spatula (palta) as this helps in scraping the gram flour mixture.When the mixture comes together in one mass and you see some ghee at the sides, then also continue to stir and scrape.When you see many small bubbles and holes in the mixture, then switch off the heat.If you cook too much, then you will get a very hard mysore pak.Setting Mysore PakImmediately and quickly tilt the kadai and pour the whole mixture in the pan. It falls in one lot and you don’t need to use any spoon for it.Level with a spatula or the back of small glass or a small steel bowl.Let the mysore pak mixture become warm or cool down. If there is too much ghee at the sides or top, then invert the pan after 20 to 30 minutes, so that the excess ghee is removed. You can use this ghee while preparing dosa or greasing idli plates.Once warm or cooled, then just invert the pan on a chopping board or tray or plate. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan. The mysore pak block falls of easily. Then cut the mysore pak into rectangular or square pieces.Store in an air-tight container. It stays good for about a week to ten days at room temperature.Serve as a festive sweet to your family or friends.",NutritionCalories: 217kcal | Carbohydrates: 23g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 33mg | Sodium: 7mg | Potassium: 78mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 19g | Vitamin A: 4IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.04mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.01mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 0.2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.04mg | Vitamin E: 0.1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 6mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 37µg | Iron: 0.5mg | Magnesium: 15mg | Phosphorus: 27mg | Zinc: 0.2mg

Then line a muslin cheesecloth or kitchen cotton towel on the strainer.Pour the fresh curd. Do use fresh curd and not one which has gone sour.Bring the four edges of the muslin together and tie one edge tightly around the rest.Gently press and you will see the whey dripping.Now place a heavy bowl or lid or tray on the tied muslin. If you have a hook, you can also hung the muslin in your refrigerator. Now keep the whole thing in the fridge for 4 to 5 hours or overnight.I kept for 24 hours. Do use a deep bowl below, so that there is some distance between the curd in the strainer and the collected whey. Otherwise the whey will touch the strainer as well as the curd. Thus there will be some whey in the curd.Next day the whey will be drained and the hung curd will be ready. Use the collected nutrient rich greenish whey in your everyday food like preparing chapatis, gravies, rice dishes, dals etc.With a silicon spatula, collect the hung curd in a container or lidded bowl if not using it. Cover with its lid and then refrigerate. With the hung curd you can now proceed to make the shrikhand.Making shrikhand with hung yogurtTake warm milk in a small bowl. Add 2 pinch of saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.In a mortar powder 4 to 5 green cardamoms. Keep aside.Take the chakka or hung curd in a bowl.Add fine sugar. Lightly stir with a spatula or spoon. You can also use powdered sugar.Then add the saffron dissolved milk and powdered saffron.Using an electric beater, begin to whip the hung curd. You can also beat the hung yogurt in a blender.Whip till smooth. The sugar should also dissolve. Check the taste and add more sugar if required.With a silicon spatula scrape the beaters’ sides and edges of the hung curd and add to the bowl.You can chill the shrikhand in fridge and later serve. While serving shrikhand, top with some sliced dry fruits. You can also top shrikhand with crushed dry fruits. I added some crushed pistachios for garnish.Making greek yogurt shrikhandIn a small bowl, take milk and warm it on a stove top or in a microwave. Add a pinch of saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.Then in a mixing bowl take the chilled greek yogurt.Add fine or superfine sugar or raw sugar or powdered sugar. Add sugar according to your taste. First add ⅓ cup and if required you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons more. For a more sweeter taste add ½ cup sugar. With a wired whisk and with brisk round movements, mix sugar with the yogurt, as well as beat the yogurt until it becomes smooth and without any tiny yogurt granules.You should get a smooth, creamy consistency in the yogurt.Now add the saffron soaked milk, cardamom powder and 2 to 3 pinches of nutmeg powder.Mix again very well.Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to a couple of hours. You can also keep overnight or for a couple of days.While serving, sprinkle some sliced or chopped nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios, chironji) and 2 to 3 saffron strands (optional).Serving suggestionsServe shrikhand plain as it is like a sweet dessert or have it with poori or chapati.

Then peel both and slice or chop them. Set aside.Making rabriIn a broad thick bottomed pan or sauce pan or a kadai take the whole milk and bring to a boil. Stir the milk a few times when it is coming to a boil, to avoid it from getting browned or stuck to the pan. Then add milk powder (I used nestle brand) . The addition of milk powder reduces the cooking time of rabri. Milk powder is not essential and if you don't have then also it is fine. Just that you will have to simmer the milk for some more minutes.Add masala milk powder. Again optional and if you don't have just add a pinch of crushed saffron and ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder.Remove the clotted cream or malai which forms on top of the milk and add it back to the milk. Also keep on scraping the dried milk from the sides and add them back to the milk.Do stir and scrape often so that the milk does not get browned or burnt from the bottom as well as the sides.Keep on simmering, stirring, removing the clotted cream and scraping.Switch off when the milk has reduced to one-third of its original volume and become thickened.Add sugar. Stir well so that the sugar dissolves.Next add crushed saffron and kewra water (pandanus water) or rose water. Skip this step, if you have added saffron earlier. You can also add sliced almonds and pistachios here. I did not add as I have already added homemade masala milk powder, which is finely ground dry fruits with a few fragrant spices.It will take about 1 hour for the milk to thicken on a low to medium-low heat.Pan frying breadSlice the crusts of the bread. Cut them into squares, rectangles or triangles.Heat 1 tablespoons of ghee in a flat pan, tava or frying pan.Place the bread slices and on a medium-low to medium heat toast them.When one side is browned, flip and toast the other side.Flip once or twice more to get an even golden color and browning.Drain the bread slices on paper towels.Add 1 tablespoon ghee again and toast the remaining batch. Keep all the toasted bread side.Making sugar syrupMix sugar with in a pan. You can begin with the sugar syrup when you start to toast bread slices.Keep the sugar solution on a low heat.The mixture would start to come to a boil.Cook till you get a one thread consistency in the sugar syrup.Switch off the heat, when one thread consistency is reached in the sugar syrup. Add cardamom powder and stir.In case the syrup cools and crystallizes before you soak the bread in it, then add about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of water and reheat the syrup until lightly hot.Making shahi tukdaNow dip the bread slices in the sugar syrup. With the help of a spoon or small tongs, coat the bread slices evenly with the sugar syrup. If this is difficult for you, then just pour the sugar syrup evenly on a neatly arranged bed of bread slices.Arrange the sugar syrup soaked bread slices neatly in a serving tray or plate.Pour the rabri on the sugar syrup coated bread slices.Garnish with sliced blanched almonds and pistachios.Serve the rich royal Shahi Tukda.If not serving  shahi tukda immediatedly, then keep in the fridge in a covered container.

Take the grated khoya in a heavy kadai or skillet. You will need 1 cup tightly packed grated khoya. You can use homemade or store brought khoya. I have used instant khoya. Add sugar and cardamom powder.Keep the pan on a stove top on a low heat.Then mix the khoya with the sugar very well. Next add milk and again stir to combine. Keep stirring often. You will see the sugar melting and the mixture getting a liquid consistency.Continuously keep on stirring and simmer the peda mixture with a spatula. You have to stir non-stop so that the mixture does not get browned from the bottom.Stir often and the mixture will start bubbling.Continue to stir and cook till the mixture thickens and leaves the sides of the pan.Then immediately pour the entire peda mixture in a steel plate or a tray. When you pour the mixture it will still be in a molten state but thickened. Do not over cook as then the pedas will become chewy.Let it become warm at room temperature.Making doodh pedaNow take small portions from the lukewarm peda mixture and roll them into small to medium balls.Place a few slivered pistachios or almonds on top of each peda ball.With a peda maker, press each ball to give a distinct design on top of it. If you do not have a peda maker, then just roll the mixture in balls and then flatten them. Press a few almonds or pistachios on top.Make a design on all doodh peda with the peda maker. In case the doodh peda falls flat and does hold shape, then they are slightly undercooked.

Try my authentic Punjabi recipe of this scrumptious Shakkarpare snack that you can literally munch on, any time!",5minutes,45minutes,50minutes,450,grams,"Snacks, Sweets",North Indian,Vegetarian,For the dough▢ 240 grams whole wheat flour  (atta) or 2 cups whole wheat flour▢ 2 tablespoons Ghee▢ ½ cup water or add as required,"Making Shakarpara DoughTake whole wheat flour in a mixing bowl or pan. Add 2 tablespoons of ghee. The ghee should be at room temperature and in a semi solid state. Instead of whole wheat flour you can also take all purpose flour and oil instead of ghee.With your fingertips, mix the ghee with the flour very well.When you press the flour and ghee mixture in your palm, you should get a flour lump like shown in the picture below. The mixture should be able to hold itself together without falling apart.Now add water in parts. Depending on the quality of flour, you can add less or more water. I added ½ cup water.Begin to knead the dough. Add water as required. If you use all-purpose flour, you will need less water.Knead to a firm semi soft dough. Neither too soft nor too hard. The dough should be not soft like the dough we make for chapatis.Divide the dough into three equal parts. Cover with a lid.Take one part and roll into a thick paratha of 7 to 8 inches in diameter.With a knife make squares or diamond shapes on the rolled dough, by slicing criss cross or vertically-horizontally.Frying ShakkarpareHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Test the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough in the pan. This small piece of the dough should come up gradually and quickly on the surface. If it comes slowly, the oil has a lower temperature and if it comes up too quickly, the oil has high temperature. I fried on medium heat. You can regulate the heat while frying by increasing or decreasing it.Slid the cut diamond shaped dough in the medium hot oil.Depending on the pan size, you can add more or less. But do make sure that there is some space while frying them.When the shakkarpara are crisp and light golden, turn over and fry.Keep on frying them and turning as and when needed for even frying.Fry till all of them turn golden.Remove with a slotted spoon and drain shakkar pare on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.Continue to prepare the shakkarpara and fry them as mentioned in the above steps.When you are begin frying the last batch, you can start preparing the sugar syrup. Let all the shakkarpara come to room temperature, before you add them in the sugar syrup.Making sugar syrupTake 1 cup sugar in another kadai or pan. Add ½ cup water.Keep the pan on a low to medium heat. Stir so that the sugar dissolves.Continue cooking the sugar syrup till it starts bubbling and getting sticky. A suggestion here is to add some saffron strands in sugar syrup to get orange or yellow colored shakkarpara.Simmer till you get a 2 to 3 thread consistency in the syrup. To check the consistency, take a bit of the syrup in a spoon. Let it become warm and then take the syrup between your forefinger and thumb. Press and separate the fingers. You should see two to three threads in the sugar syrup.Once the two to three thread consistency is reached, quickly add all the shakkarpara in the syrup.Briskly stir and toss well, so that all the shakkarpara are coated with the sugar syrup.The sugar syrup crystallizes soon, so mix very well and be quick.Now take all the shakkarpara in a plate and allow them to come at room temperature. The sugar syrup will crystallize on cooling.Once all of them cool down, store shakkarpara in an air-tight box or jar. These stay good for a few months.",NutritionServing: 1small bowl | Calories: 276kcal | Carbohydrates: 47g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 9g | Saturated Fat: 3g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 8mg | Sodium: 3mg | Potassium: 116mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 25g | Vitamin A: 2IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 13mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 13µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 41mg | Phosphorus: 107mg | Zinc: 1mg

Fry for some seconds till their colour changes. remove and keep aside.Frying gondNow in the same ghee, add one piece of gond. If the gond comes up gradually and puffs up, the oil is ready for the gond to be fried. If the gond settles down in the oil, then increase the flame and let oil become hot. If the gond comes up quickly, then oil is very hot. Reduce the flame to lower the oil temperature.Add gond in two batches. If you are an experienced cook, then add gond in a single batch. Stir non-stop and fry gond till all of them puff up.The gond pieces have to be fried evenly. So stir non-stop. Fry them well in ghee and do not burn them.Remove the puffed up gond in a slotted spoon. Keep the fried gond aside and let it cool.Roasting wheat flourReduce the heat to a low and then add 2 cups whole wheat flour in the same ghee.Mix flour very well with ghee. Begin to roast flour with the ghee.Meanwhile when atta is getting roasted, add fried nuts in a grinder jar or spice-grinder. Also add the fried gond in a dry grinder jar.Pulse and grind to a semi fine or coarse powder. You can keep the nuts whole if you prefer instead of powdering them.Do note that atta is getting roasted when you grind the fried gond. If you are not able to multitask then switch off heat after frying gond. Crush gond in grinder. Then switch on heat again and let ghee become slightly hot. Add atta and roast. You can also use a belan (rolling pin) and crush gond. Keep the powdered gond and nuts aside.Continue to keep on stirring and roasting the atta.Roast atta till its color changes and you get a nutty aroma.Then stir nonstop when you see the flour changing its color.Stir and roast till the atta becomes golden or brown. Overall it took me a total of 17 minutes for the atta to get roasted to perfection.Note that the timing will vary with the material, size and thickness of the kadai or pan. If you use steel kadai, then it will take less time.Making gond ke ladduSwitch off the heat. Keep the kadai down and raisins and cardamom powder.Next add the powdered sugar. add the crushed gond and nuts mixture.Begin to mix with a spoon. While mixing, break the sugar lumps if any in the ladoo mixture with a spatula or spoon. Mix very well.When the laddu mixture is still hot and the heat is tolerable to you, take a heaped size portion of it in a spoon or in your palms. Shape in a round ladoo. In case the heat is not tolerable, then do wait for some minutes. Avoid burning your hands. If the mixture does not hold shape, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons ghee. Note that the ghee should be in a semi-solid state at room temperature.Make medium sized ladoo from this whole mixture. Store them in an airtight steel container (steel dabba). They stay good for a couple of months. This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled. From this gond laddu recipe, you can make 17 to 18 laddu.Serve Gond ke Laddu just by itself or with some hot or warm milk. ",NutritionCalories: 235kcal | Carbohydrates: 30g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 7g | Cholesterol: 26mg | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 100mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 13g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 11mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 8µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 30mg | Phosphorus: 75mg | Zinc: 1mg

Then rub and mix the ghee with the flours, with your fingertips to form a bread crumb like texture.Add water in parts and begin to knead. The amount of water needed will depend on the quality and texture of the flour.Knead the dough till firm and tight. Cover the dough with a moist cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.Making sweet stuffingCrumble or grate the khoya (mawa).Chop the nuts, raisins and set aside.Melt ghee in a pan on a low heat.Add the crumbled or grated khoya.Stir the khoya continuously on a low heat.Cook the khoya, till it begins to gather around itself. Switch off the heat and place the pan on the kitchen countertop. Let the khoya stuffing cool completely at room temperature. Later add powdered sugar, the chopped nuts, raisins and cardamom powder. Better to sieve the powdered sugar if there are lumps.Mix everything well and keep the stuffing aside. Check the taste and add more sugar if you prefer.Assembling and shapingDivide the dough into two parts.Make a medium log of each part and slice it into equal parts.Roll each part in your palms to make balls and place all the balls in the same bowl. Cover with a moist kitchen towel.Dust the rolling board lightly with some flour. Roll each ball with the rolling pin to a small circle having 4 to 5 inches diameter. Don't add too much flour while rolling. If you can roll without the flour, then it is better.With your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply water all over the circumference edge.Place about 1 to 1.5 tablespoon of the prepared khoya filling on one side of the circle, keeping the edges empty. Don’t add too much of stuffing as it becomes difficult to shape gujiya and they may break in the oil.Carefully, bring together both the edges and join. Gently press the edges.With a small gujiya cutter or pizza cutter, trim the extra edges. When doing this method, it is very important that the gujiya is pressed and sealed well. Avoid this method if you plan to fry the gujiya. If baking then this method is good. As even if the filling comes out, you don't have to worry as there is no mess.However, it is best to make pleated design at the edges if you plan to fry the gujiya. This way the stuffing does not come out while frying and the gujiya look good too. Just keep on folding and twisting the edges till the end.Prepare gujiya this way and arrange them on a plate or tray. Cover the guijya with a moist napkin so that the dough does not dry out.Baking gujiyaPreheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius (390 degree fahrenheit). Brush oil or melted ghee n the gujiya evenly all over.Place them in a baking tray.Bake the mawa gujiya for 20 to 30 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (390 degree Fahrenheit), until they are golden. Oven temperatures vary, so do keep a check while baking. Place them on a wire rack for cooling. Once cooled, store them in an air-tight jar or box.Frying gujiyaHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.First test the temperature of oil, before frying. Add a small piece of the dough in the oil. If the dough comes up gradually and briskly, then the oil is ready. If the dough sits at the bottom, the oil is still cold. If the piece of dough comes up briskly and quickly, the oil is too hot.Gently slid the gujiya in oil. Just add a few pieces and don't overcrowd. At a time depending on the size of the pan/wok/kadai, you can fry 2 to 3 gujiya at a time on medium-heat. Turn them over carefully as fry the other side. Deep fry till they have become golden turning over as needed. Drain on kitchen paper tissues. Fry all gujiya this way and once they are cooled completely at room temperature, store them in an air-tight box.Serve gujiya to your family and guests when required.Serving suggestionsGujiya is eaten like any Indian sweet as it is. If you fancy something more indulgent, pair the mawa gujiya with some Rabri (thickened sweetened milk).StorageWhen the gujia cools at room temperature, immediately place them in an air-tight jar. They stay good for a few hours at room temperature. Since the stuffing is made with milk solids, I suggest to keep any leftovers in the refrigerator for about 1 to 2 days.",NutritionCalories: 221kcal | Carbohydrates: 24g | Protein: 6g | Fat: 12g | Saturated Fat: 5g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 10mg | Sodium: 95mg | Potassium: 76mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 81IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 123mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 25µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 23mg | Phosphorus: 63mg | Zinc: 1mg

The more light and softer the consistency, the better the chhena poda tastes.I have not added any milk or water. In case the mixture looks dry, then you can add a few tablespoons of milk or water. Some amount of fat is released while mashing chenna and thats fine.Once you get a cake batter like consistency in the paneer mixture, then add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder and ½ tablespoon rice flour. Optionally a pinch of baking soda can also be added, but does not make any difference. Instead of rice flour, you can also use fine rava (sooji). Some chopped dry fruits like cashews, almonds and raisins can also be added.baking chhena podaPour the chhena poda mixture in the pan. Shake the pan gently so that the chenna poda mixture spreads evenly. Level the top with a spatula.Place the pan in the oven and bake chena poda for 30 to 45 minutes.

Do not allow the rice to get browned.Then add milk which has been boiled before. The pre-boiled milk can be hot, warm or refrigerated.

Do stir when the milk is getting heated up, so that the bottom of the milk does not get scorched.After the milk has come to a boil, continue to simmer till the rice grains are cooked completely and softened.For quick cooking of the rice, I kept a lid on the pan. But in this case, you have to be in the kitchen so that you open the lid when the milk starts frothing up. Or else you can cook the rice uncovered. But do stir regularly.Another tip is cover the pan in such a way, so that some of the steam can be passed through.Continue to cook further till the rice grains are completely softened. After the rice grains are cooked, you can even mash them while stirring with a spoon or spatula.Once the rice grains are cooked well, add sugar. Stir so that the sugar is dissolved.Simmer for a further 8 to 10 minutes till the milk has reduced and the payasam has thickened. Do keep in mind that as this payasam cools it will thicken more, so you can decide the consistency which you prefer.Serve Paal Payasam as is or garnished with saffron, rose petals or sliced almonds.

You can also sift the flour separately in a plate or tray.Add 1 pinch salt, 1 pinch baking soda and ½ teaspoon baking powder.Sift directly in the creamed ghee and curd.Mix the flour lightly with the creamed ghee and curd using  a spoon or spatula.Sprinkle some cold water in parts and begin to mix it. Overall you can use 8 to 9 tablespoons cold water. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water at a time and mix.Mix and combine everything to form a soft dough. Do not knead. Just mix and bring everything together to a dough. In case the dough becomes sticky, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Use light pressure from hands and form a dough. At this point, do not knead heavily or if required then knead very lightly.Cover the dough and keep aside for 15 minutes.Making sugar syrupMeanwhile make sugar syrup. While frying balushahi also you can make sugar syrup. Take 200 grams sugar or 1 heaped cup of sugar in a pan or bowl. Use a bowl or pan with more surface area so that the balushahi can get enough space for soaking.Add ½ cup water and mix.Place the pan on a low heat.Using a spoon stir the sugar so that it dissolves. If there are impurities in the sugar syrup, then add 1 tablespoon milk. Remove the scum that forms at the top.When all the sugar has dissolved, add ½ to 1 teaspoon green cardamom powder. Then add 10 to 12 saffron strands. Stir and mix again.Simmer the sugar solution on a low to medium-low heat. Do stir occasionally. To avoid crystallization of sugar, you can add some drops of lemon juice.Simmer till the syrup becomes sticky or you get ½ string consistency in the syrup. You can even cook it to 1 string consistency.The sugar syrup should be sticky. So cool syrup in a spoon and touch it and it should feels sticky. When the syrup becomes sticky, then switch off heat.Frying balushahiBefore frying balushahi you can begin to heat oil in a kadai or pan on a medium heat. You can also use ghee instead of oil to fry balushahi.Do use a kadai with handles at the sides. Pinch small to medium-sized balls from the dough. Roll them gently and lightly between your palms.Then make an indent or depression in them. You can flatten them slightly if you want. Make 5 to 6 badhusha depending on the size of kadai.Cover the remaining dough and keep aside. Check a tiny piece of the badhusha dough in the medium hot oil. It should come up gradually and steadily.Now lift the kadai from stove top and keep it on the kitchen table top. Gently begin to place balushahi in the hot oil.Be careful when you are keeping the balushahi in hot oil. Add 5 to 6 or 7 balushahi depending on the size of kadai. The badushah will expand in oil while frying, so make sure not to over crowd the kadai or pan.Now lift the kadai and place it again on a low heat.Begin to fry badusha on a low heat.When one side firms up and is light golden, turn over each badusha.Keep on turning them over at intervals and frying them on a low heat.Frying balushahi on a low flame takes about 12 to 15 minutes. This will depend on the size, thickness of kadai and the intensity of flame. It took me 14 minutes to fry each batch of 6 balushahi.Fry till golden and crisp.Using a slotted spoon remove them draining the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. When the first batch is getting fried, you can make balushahi from the dough and keep them ready to fry in the second round. Keep the shaped and prepared balushahi covered with a kitchen napkin. Then fry the second batch of balushahi in the same way.Making balushahiAfter a couple of minutes, when fried balushahi are still hot, place them in the hot or warm sugar syrup.With spoon or tongs turn over each badusha, so that both sides are coated with sugar syrup. Let these badusha soak in the sugar syrup for about 14 to 15 minutes.After 14 to 15 minutes, using tongs or spoon, lift each balushahi and place it in a serving tray or bowl. In the same sugar syrup, now add the second batch of balushahi.Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of pistachios all over. You can even sprinkle some saffron strand, rose petals and cardamom powder if you want. Press the pistachios, so that they stick to the sugar syrup on the badusha.Fry the remaining badusha and then soak them in the sugar syrup.

This will make the process super simple.I used one pot to melt the jaggery, strained the cleaned jaggery into another pot.You will need two separate pans – one to dry roast the murmura/puffed rice, another to heat the cleaned jaggery and making ladoos. Instead you can use the same pan to roast and later to heat jaggery. Keep a small bowl of water ready. This is for checking the thickness of the syrup.Making murmura laddu mixtureNow, on medium heat dry roast the murmura/ pori or puffed rice for 1 to 2 minutes, so that it crisps up. Keep this aside or transfer to another bowl.To a separate pot, add ½ cup of the grated/powdered jaggery and 4 tablespoons of water.Heat this until with constant stirring all the jaggery melts and gets mixed with the water. Turn off the heat.Now, pass the melted jaggery through a sieve to remove impurities. Collect the clean melted jaggery in another pot/container.Now, pour this clean jaggery mixture into a pan and heat on a low flame. Keep stirring the mixture.Add cardamom powder and continue to stir.After a couple of minutes, if you hold up the ladle with drops of the syrup falling back into the pan, the last drop should form a sort of string as it falls. Keep checking the thickness as the syrup heats.To ascertain the thickness of the syrup, add a couple of drops into a bowl of water. The droplets should not dissolve into the water.You should be able to pick up the drop which will form a soft to firm ball. This is the right consistency.Now, pour this prepared syrup into the murmura/puffed rice. Instead you can reduce the heat of the heated syrup pan and add murmura/puffed rice into the prepared syrup. If doing for the first time, I would suggest, pour the puffed rice into the jaggery syrup, mix, then make laddus.Add roasted gram, mix everything very well using a spatula.Making pori urundaiThe ladoo have to be prepared when the pori urundai mixture is still hot, otherwise the mixture will harden and making ladoo will be difficult.Wet your palms slightly with water, pick up a portion of the prepared mixture and form ladoo by pressing gently between your palms and giving it a spherical shape.Prepare ladoo with the rest of the mixture in the same manner.If towards the end the mixture becomes too hard, put the pan back on gentle heat for a few seconds.

They should be completely softened and look translucent. The milk will also thicken by the time the sago pearls are cooked.Some milk solids will be stuck at the sides. Scrape them with a spoon or spatula and add back to the payasam. Keep in mind that the payasam thickens after cooling. So if you want a thin payasam, you can add some more hot milk and sugar as needed at this step.Lastly add the fried cashews and raisins along with 1 pinch edible camphor (optional). Mix well.Serve Javvarisi Payasam hot or warm or chilled as a dessert after meals.

In another pan or kadai, take ghee and let it melt.Keep the heat to low or medium-low and then add fine rava (suji).Also, add cashews.Roast the rava in the ghee on a low to medium-low heat, stirring often.The rava has to be roasted well and should become fragrant. This is an important step and if the rava is not roasted well enough, the sheera will become sticky or lumpy.By the time the rava is roasted, the cashews will also become light golden. Once the rava is roasted well then it will become aromatic and its color will also change. The rava grains start to look dry, separate and crisp. The ghee will also start separating.Meantime, the water will also start boiling.Once the rava is roasted, then add the mango puree and raisins to it and mix well.Add the boiling water in a slow stream. Be careful as the mixture splutters.As soon as you add the hot water, quickly begin to stir the kesari, so that lumps are not formed. For best results, use a wired whisk while stirring.You will see that the rava absorbs water and the sheera begins to thicken.After stirring, cover the pan with a lid and on a low heat simmer the sheera for 2 to 3 minutes.All the water will be absorbed and the mango kesari will be done. If you want, you can add some more ghee at this step.Serve Mango Kesari hot, warm or at room temperature.

When it comes to a room temperature, then you can refrigerate and serve later if you prefer that.On cooling and refrigerating payasam will thicken. So keep it to a slight flowing consistency when you want to serve it cold, so that it does not thicken too much. If at all the payasam has thickened too much, then simply add a bit of milk to thin the consistency.StorageIf there any leftovers, then refrigerate for 3 to 4 days in a covered container. I would not recommend freezing as the taste and texture changes and becomes way off. After refrigeration, you can reheat the payasam on low heat if you want to eat it hot or warm. Add some milk or water if the consistency has thickened too much.

120,Gulab Jamun With Milk Powder,https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gulab-jamun-recipe-2-1-280x280.jpg,"This Gulab Jamun With Milk Powder is a cheat's version but tastes equally good. The recipe comes handy if you don’t have khoya or paneer/chenna readily available. All you need is milk powder, curd (yogurt), sugar and water to make a tasty homemade batch of this famous Indian sweet.",30minutes,20minutes,50minutes,14,Milk Powder Gulab Jamuns,Sweets,North Indian,Vegetarian,For the Jamun▢ 1  cup  milk powder▢ ¼  cup  all-purpose flour▢ 1  teaspoon  oil  OR ½ teaspoon ghee▢ 1 pinch salt  (optional)▢ 1 pinch baking soda▢ 1 to 2  tablespoons Curd (yogurt)▢ 1 tablespoon pistachios – blanched or almond slices; for garnish,"Making Sugar SyrupFirst mix the sugar, water, cardamom powder and saffron in a pan and keep it on the stovetop.Gently bring to a boil and continue to stir occasionally.Add some pistachios in the syrup. An optional step but tastes good. Make a thick sticky syrup and turn off the stovetop; much before the sugar solution reaches a one thread consistency.You can cook the sugar syrup till it reaches a half string consistency. On cooling, if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.Making Milk Powder Dough BallsMix the milk powder, all-purpose flour or maida, a pinch of baking soda, a pinch of salt (optional) in a mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon oil OR ½ teaspoon ghee and 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh curd or yogurt.Just mix everything lightly. Add some more curd if the mixture looks dry. Don’t over mix or knead. You don’t want gluten to form, so just mixing well is enough. The all-purpose flour is just added to bind the mixture. If gluten forms then the dough balls become dense and won’t absorb any of the sugar syrup and the jamun will not be soft.The mixture will be sticky but smooth. Apply some oil on your palms and make small balls from the dough. These dough balls almost double when frying and also increase when soaked in the sugar syrup. So don’t make large sized balls.There should be no cracks on the dough balls. They should be smooth. If there are cracks, then just add some 1 or 2 teaspoons of curd or milk to the mixture and continue making the balls.Once done, then cover the balls with a kitchen towel.Frying Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or a pan. When the oil becomes medium hot, lower the heat. Add a small ball in the oil. The ball should slowly rise to the top from the bottom. If it does not rise then, the oil is not hot enough. If it rises quickly and browns also quickly, then the oil is too hot to fry.If the small ball does not crack or break while frying, you are alright to proceed further. If it cracks, then just add some 1 or 2 teaspoons flour to the dough and form the balls again. In an ideal case, the dough ball should not crack and should rise slowly to the top and should not get browned quickly.When you know the oil is hot enough and on a low heat or medium-low heat, then add 3 to 4 balls or more depending on the capacity of your kadai or pan. When the sides touching the oil, become light golden or golden, turn over the dough balls with a slotted spoon and fry the remaining sides. The balls have to be stirred with a slotted spoon frequently to get even browning. But take care as hot oil is there in the pan. The balls should also not become browned too soon. They have to be cooked from the inside too.Keep on turning the balls until they become golden. If the oil becomes cold, then don’t fry the balls. Increase the temperature and then fry. Otherwise, the balls would have a hard crisp thick cover when fried in a less hot oil and they won’t absorb the sugar syrup. Plus they would absorb a lot of oil too.Soaking jamun in sugar syrupWhen the balls are evenly golden and browned, remove from the slotted spoon and add them directly into the sugar syrup.Keep the fried golden balls in the sugar syrup for at least 1 to 2 hours before serving. This is done so that the jamun soaks up the sugar syrup which will make them soft and sweet. That’s why in the sweet shops, the gulab jamun are always soaked in sugar syrup.If you feel the jamun is not soaking in the sugar syrup, then warm the gulab jamuns together with the sugar syrup on stove-top for a couple of minutes. Cover and set aside. Just warm the sugar syrup, don’t heat.Gulab jamun can be served warm or cold. If they are at room temperature, then warm in the microwave and serve them topped with sugar syrup and garnished with pistachios or almond slices.",NutritionServing: 1gulab jamun | Calories: 144kcal | Carbohydrates: 27g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 3g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 9mg | Sodium: 59mg | Potassium: 133mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 25g | Vitamin A: 85IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 90mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 7µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 10mg | Phosphorus: 75mg | Zinc: 1mg

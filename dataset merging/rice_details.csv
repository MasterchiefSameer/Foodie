Don’t over cook the vegetables.Warm 4 to 5 tablespoons milk in a microwave or in a small pan on the stove top. Add ¼ teaspoon of saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.When the pressure settles down on its own, remove the lid and check the gravy. If the vegetables are under cooked, then keep the cooker on the stove top and simmer the biryani gravy without the lid, till the vegetables are tender.

Cover the cooked rice and set aside until the rice cools completely. You can even refrigerate rice with a covered lid for 30 minutes. Chopping veggiesWhen the cooked rice is cooling, chop the veggies finely and keep aside. Remember to chop the french beans very finely. They take more time to cook than other veggies. You can also blanch them first and then cook. Another option is to add the beans first and then add the other vegetables.Making veg fried riceHeat oil in a wok or a pan. First add the star anise and fry for a few seconds or until the oil becomes fragrant.Add the garlic, ginger and sauté for some seconds. No need to brown the garlic.

When the rice is warm, cover and keep so that the rice grains do not dry out.While the rice is cooking, rinse, peel and chop the raw mango.Making mango paste In a grinder jar, add the chopped mangoes along with dried red chilies (broken and deseeded), chopped green chili, sesame seeds, peanuts, grated coconut and powdered or grated jaggery. I added jaggery to balance the sourness of the mangoes. If you don't have dried red chilies, add a total of 2 to 3 green chilies. I used Byadgi red chilies which are not very hot. If using a hotter variety of red chilies, reduce the amount to 1 or 2.Without adding any water, grind to a semi-fine paste. Don't make a fine paste. Keep aside.Making mango riceIn a pan, heat oil and add peanuts.On low heat, sauté the peanuts till they change color.Then, bring the peanuts to the side of the pan and add mustard seeds in the center. Let the mustard seeds crackle. You can also add 1 teaspoon each of chana dal and urad dal at this step. If adding chana dal or urad dal, allow them to turn golden before you proceed to the next step.When the mustard seeds crackle, add curry leaves and dried red chilies. Stir and sauté till the red chilies change color.Then, add asafoetida and turmeric powder. Mix well.Now, add the ground raw mango-coconut-spices paste. Stir and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes on low to medium-low heat or until the mixture thickens more and comes together. Next, season with salt.Stir and mix very well again. Remove pan from the stovetop and set aside on the kitchen countertop.Add the sautéed raw mango-coconut-spices masala to the cooked rice. You can mix in batches or at once. The rice has to be at room temperature before you start mixing.Now, with your hands, gently mix the rice with the raw mango-coconut-spices masala. I mixed both the cooked rice and the masala in batches in a bowl.Serve Mango Rice with some fried papads or chips. You can also serve with some yogurt or pickle. While serving, you can also garnish Mango Rice with chopped coriander leaves if you prefer.",NutritionCalories: 530kcal | Carbohydrates: 74g | Protein: 10g | Fat: 22g | Saturated Fat: 6g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 9g | Sodium: 634mg | Potassium: 332mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 12g | Vitamin A: 983IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 38mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 85mg | Vitamin E: 3mg | Vitamin K: 4µg | Calcium: 65mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 403µg | Iron: 2mg | Magnesium: 59mg | Phosphorus: 161mg | Zinc: 1mg

Later drain the water very well and set the lentils aside.Grate half of a medium to large coconut and keep aside. You need about 1.5 cups of tightly packed finely grated coconut.Cooking riceAfter 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and pressure cook the rice with 1.75 to 2 cups water for 2 whistles or 5 to 6 minutes on medium to medium-high heat in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker.If you do not have a pressure cooker, cook rice in a pot or pan or the Instant Pot. Find the details below.Cooking in a pot or pan: Take the soaked rice and 2 cups of water in a pan. Cover and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until rice grains are tender and the water has been absorbed. If the most of the water has evaporated and the rice grains look undercooked, add a few tablespoons of hot water. Cover and continue to cook rice.Cooking in Instant Pot: Transfer the rice grains and 1.5 cups water in the Instant Pot. Seal the lid and position the valve to sealing. Pressure cook on high pressure for 4 to 5 minutes. When the cooking is complete and you hear the beep sound, wait for 5 minutes before giving a quick pressure release. Open the lid and transfer the rice to a tray or plate for cooling.When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and fluff the rice. For a softer texture in the rice, pressure cook for 3 whistlesTake the rice in a plate/tray and allow to cool grains completely. You can also cool the rice in the cooker itself. If there are lumps in the rice, then break the lumps once the rice is cooled.Making temperingHeat coconut oil in a pan. You can also use sesame oil or any other neutral oil. Reduce the heat to a low. Crackle mustard seeds first in the hot oil. Add the chana dal and urad dal. Stir and fry for about a minute.Then add chopped cashews.Stir and fry till the cashews turn golden. The lentils would also turn golden by then.Add red chilies, curry leaves and chopped green chilies along with a pinch of asafetida.Stir and fry until the red chilies change color and the curry leaves become crisp.Making coconut riceNext add grated coconut.

The coconut can be sautéed until it get a cream-ish color or a faint light beige color.Lastly add the steamed rice and salt.Combine and mix the rice well. Switch off the heat.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe coconut rice hot or warm. If you like you can garnish with chopped coriander leaves and drizzling with a bit of ghee while serving. You can also choose to drizzle some lemon juice on the rice while eating.You can serve coconut rice as is or pair with a gravy or curry like vegetable stew, potato roast, vegetable kurma, cauliflower kurma, potato curry or moong lentils curry or a simple dal and even plain homemade fresh curd or yogurt. I suggest pairing with gravy or curry for a really flavorful meal. Accompany some papadum (appalam) if you like.Since this rice has coconut, it is best had fresh. I do not recommend to store this rice in the fridge as the chances of coconut going rancid are very high. Moreover it is best to eat rice when freshly cooked.

Cover the strainer and set rice aside. Note: Do not touch the rice as the grains can break. Rinsing rice ensures that the rice does not cook further.Prepping Soya ChunksIn a strainer or colander, rinse 1 cup soya chunks a few times with water. Drain the water. Next, place the soya chunks, water and salt in a pan. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes.Drain the water. Rinse soya chunks in fresh water again. Drain the water again and squeeze the chunks thoroughly to remove any excess moisture. Set aside. Note that there should not be any water logged in the chunks. Infusing SaffronTake warm water (or choice of milk) in a small bowl. Add saffron strand and set aside to steep for 5 to 10 minutes. Making Biryani GravyHeat oil or ghee in a pot. Reduce the heat and add the whole spices – tej patta, cinnamon, cloves, green cardamoms, star anise, black cardamom and caraway seeds. Fry for a few seconds so that the spices crackle and release their flavors in the oil. Do not burn them.Add sliced onions. Stirring often, sauté the onions on medium-low to medium heat. Add a few pinches of salt to quicken the process cooking of onions. Cook them to the point where they become golden and caramelized. Do not brown them too much or burn them or else the biryani will have a bitter taste.When the onions become golden, turn off the heat.Place the pan on the countertop and remove half of the caramelized onions to set aside. If a few spices from the pan pop in with the onions, that is fine.Add ginger-garlic paste and place the pan back on the stove-top on a low heat. Sauté ginger-garlic paste for a few seconds until the raw aroma goes away. At this step we will add the ground spices. If you prefer, switch off the heat here.Add turmeric powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder and grated nutmeg.Mix and sauté for about 30 seconds to a minute on a low heat taking care not to burn the spices.Add tomato puree (or chopped tomatoes) and mint leaves. Add coriander leaves if using. Mix and sauté on a low heat until the mixture becomes pulpy and you see the fat releasing from the sides. If using chopped tomatoes, the tomatoes should soften and become mushy. Add the prepared soya chunks, frozen green peas (optional) and salt.Add water and combine well. Cover the pan and simmer on low to medium-low heat for 10 minutes.Switch off heat and place pan on the countertop. Add coconut milk and kewra water (pandanus water) or rosewater. If using curd, add 1 cup whisked/beaten curd at this point. Mix well. Note: Use fresh curd and not sour curd. Mix and cook on a low heat until the gravy becomes hot. Do not boil, as this would result in separation of the coconut milk or curd.Layering Soya BiryaniNow that the gravy is ready, it is time to layer the biryani for dum cooking. You can make two or four layers. (If you plan to make 4 layers, remove half the gravy from the pan and set it aside.) Spread rice evenly all over the gravy. (If you are making a 4-layer biryani, use only half the rice.)Sprinkle the golden caramelized onions and chopped mint leaves all over. Pour the saffron infused water (or choice of milk) all over the bed of rice. (If you are making a 4-layer biryani, use only half the elements listed, then repeat with gravy, rice, onions, mint and saffron liquid.)Cover the pan with a moistened muslin/cheesecloth or any cotton napkin. You can also seal the pan tightly with a foil. Seal tightly with the pan’s lid.Note: If you do not a lid for a pan, place a steel lid/plate on the wet cloth. Keep a heavy weight object like a mortar-pestle on the steel lid/plate, so that steam does not escape. Dum Cooking Meal Maker BiryaniPlace the pot on a skillet/tawa. First cook the biryani for 5 minutes on medium-high heat.Then reduce the heat and cook for 30 to 35 minutes.When you check the bottom of the pot with a fork or spoon, there should be not gravy or liquid left in the pan. If you see any liquids in the pan, then cook further for 5 to 10 minutes. Note: You can also bake in a preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes at 180 degrees celsius. Serving & StorageTo serve soya biryani, scoop out individual portions with all the layers into plates or bowls.Garnish with mint leaves or coriander leaves if you prefer. Onion salad, pickled onions, raita, lemon wedges, papad or any vegetable salad are great accompaniments. You can also eat it as is.Leftovers should not be kept for longer than a day in the refrigerator.

Place the mangoes in a 2-litre pressure cooker. Add 2 cups water.Pressure cook for 2 whistles on medium flame or for about 8 to 10 minutes.When pressure settles down on its own, then remove the lid. The mangoes would have become soft. The peels would have also separated  if the mangoes are cooked well.Gently pour the contents of the cooker in a fine strainer. Place a bowl underneath. Do not discard the water. Use this water to make aam panna drink.Let the mangoes cool at room temperature. Place them in a bowl. After cooking the raw mangoes, the peel comes off easily.Making syrup – Recipe 1With a sharp-edged spoon or a knife scrape and remove the cooked mango pulp directly in the bowl. Scrape from the peels also.Collect the cooked mango pulp in a bowl. Discard the peels.As a rule always add double the amount of jaggery or sugar to the mango pulp. The ratio is 1:2 for mango pulp and jaggery respectively. So before adding sugar or jaggery measure the amount of mango pulp in a measuring cup. If you get 1 cup of mango pulp, then add 2 cups of sugar. I got about ¾ cup of mango pulp and so added 1.5 cups sugar.Now add the required amount of sugar or jaggery.Add cardamom powder, roasted cumin powder, black salt, crushed black pepper or pepper powder. Mix very well. You could also use a blender or hand churner to blend the aam panna syrup.Pour the aam panna syrup in a clean glass bottle or jar. Store the bottle or jar in the fridge.Making panna drink – Recipe 1For making aam panna drink, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of aam panna syrup in a glass.Add the water in which the mangoes were cooked or chilled water. You can also add water at room temperature. Stir and mix well. Serve aam panna. You can also add some ice cubes while serving. You can even garnish with some mint leaves or coriander leaves or lemon wedges. Making Roasted Aam Panna – Recipe 2Rinse and then wipe dry the mangoes. Keep a roti rack or papad rack on a gas stove top. Place the mangoes on it.Keep on turning them at intervals so that they are charred and cooked evenly.The peels should get charred. To check doneness, slid a knife on one of the sides and the knife should slid easily without any resistance.Keep the roasted mangoes aside and let them cool at room temperature. You can also keep them in water for some minutes and then peel them. Once they cool down, then remove the charred peels. Remove the peels well. Slice the mangoes.Add the sliced mango pulp to a blender or mixer jar. Then add mint leaves, roasted cumin powder, black salt and sugar.For aam panna, the sugar is added twice of the mango pulp. I had got slightly more than ½ cup of mango pulp. Thus I added 1 cup sugar. Depending on the type and quality of mangoes the amount of pulp will vary. So do measure the pulp before you add sugar. So if you get lets say, 1 cup mango pulp, then add 2 cups sugar. Without adding any water, blend till smooth.The aam panna syrup should have a smooth consistency. If there are fibers in the pulp, then do strain it. Remove in a clean small jar or bowl. Cover and refrigerate.Preparing Roasted Aam Panna Drink – Recipe 2Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the aam panna syrup in a glass. Then add water and mix very well. Add ice cubes if you like.Serve aam panna immediately.

A slight semi fine texture is also ok. This is the dry achari masala. Keep aside.Making MarinationIn a bowl take hung yogurt or thick yogurt and whisk till smooth. To make hung yogurt, place the yogurt in a muslin cloth or a cotton napkin. Tie tightly and place on a strainer, which is kept over a bowl. Keep in the fridge till all the whey gets collected in the bowl. This takes about 4 to 5 hours. You can also keep overnight. Here I used thick yogurt.Add the powdered achari masala, red chili powder, gram flour/corn starch, ginger-garlic paste, asafoetida, coriander powder, red chili powder, dry mango powder or lime juice, crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi), salt and mustard oil. You can also use ready made achar masala or pickle masala. Add about 2 tbsp of dry achar masala in the marinade.Mix everything into the beaten curd. Check the taste and add more salt or other seasoning if required.Add the bell peppers, onions and paneer cubes.Gently mix the paneer cubes and veggies till they are evenly coated with the achari marinade.Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour or overnight. You can also keep for any number of hours.Once you remove from the the marinated cottage cheese cubes and veggies from the fridge, then gently mix again.Grilling method for making achari paneer tikkaPreheat your oven to 200 degrees celsius/390 degrees fahrenheit for at least 10 minutes before you grill the tikkas. For a regular oven, keep both the top and bottom elements on and keep the pan in the center or top rack. For a microwave oven use the convection mode and preheat at 180 degrees celsius/350 degrees fahrenheit.Thread the veggies and paneer cubes on a bamboo skewer or metal skewer. You can alsoUse toothpicks.Cover a baking tray with an aluminium foil. Avoid butter paper like I have done as the paneer sticks to the butter paper once grilled.Brush the marinated paneer with ½ to 1 teaspoon of mustard oil or any other oil.Place the tray in a the top rack or middle rack of a preheated oven. Keep both the top and bottom heating elements on. Grill at 200 degrees celsius for 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the oven temperatures). I have a slow oven, so it took 25 mins for the paneer cubes to be grilled and browned at the edges. Just keep an eye when the paneer is getting grilled in the oven. For a microwave oven in the convection mode, use 180 degrees celsius/350 degrees fahrenheit for grilling the tikka.Pan frying or stove top methodHeat about 2 to 3 teaspoon oil in a non stick pan. You can add more oil if you want.Place the threaded paneer tikka with the skewers on the pan. You can also fry the marinated paneer cubes and veggies without the skewers.Gently rotate the skewers, when one side is crisp and browned. Keep on rotating till all the sides are browned. Add more oil if required, while frying.Fry till all the sides are golden. Pan fry on a low flame as the marinade gets browned quickly. Keep the fried achari paneer tikka aside. Remember not to overcook the paneer cubes as then they can become hard or chewy.Serve with onion slices, lemon wedges and mint yogurt chutney. Sprinkle chaat masala and lemon juice on the achari paneer tikka while serving.

This can take a good amount of time, and I like to prepare a large batch at once to keep in the fridge for about a week or so and have ready as needed.After plucking the leaves rinse them thoroughly in cool running water in a large bowl. Firstly soak the leaves in enough water for a few minutes. Add some vinegar and baking soda to the water. This gets rid of pesticides if any.Swish and move them with your hands, so that they are cleaned thoroughly of any soil or mud clinging on the stems. This needs to get washed off. See that the leaves are clean and devoid of any muddy particles on them.Drain all the water and soak them in fresh water for a few more minutes. Drain the water. Repeat this process once or twice. Finally, drain all the water.Now chop the fenugreek leaves. You could do this with a knife or chop them in a food processor. While chopping in the food processor, make sure you do not chop it to fine or make a paste of it.Preparing potatoesRinse, peel and chop the potatoes into small cubes or squares.In a heavy skillet, kadai or pan, heat up the oil. Add the potatoes first.Saute the potatoes for some minutes on medium-low to medium heat until they start looking crisp and are lightly browned from the edges.Add the chopped green chilies and asafoetida. Stir. If you don't have green chilies, add about ¼ to ½ teaspoon of red chili powder or cayenne pepper.Making aloo methiNow add the chopped methi (fenugreek leaves). Mix very well.Add salt. Give a good stir, and let the aloo methi continue to cook for a couple of minutes uncovered on medium-low to medium heat. When the methi begins to produce water, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 to 6 more minutes on a low to medium-low heat. The liquid should be totally evaporated in the dish and the fenugreek leaves will become completely wilted.Sauté for a couple more minutes to get the potatoes and methi nice and dry.If your potatoes are not quite cooked when the liquid has dried up, add a tablespoon or so of water and continue to cook.Later, if you see any extra water in the pan, then simmer until all the water is dried up.Once cooked, you can either mix in a bit of butter for extra rich flavor or serve plain as-is. Serving suggestionsServe aloo methi with Indian breads like paratha, roti, naan.  You could even make this dish as a side vegetable with your Indian main course.StorageUsually there won't be any leftovers. If there are leftovers then place in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Reheat by simply warming up in a small pan or skillet sprinkling few drops of water.

Whisk the batter with a spoon or a wired whisk for about 2 minutes to aerate it. Taste test the batter and add more salt or spices if needed.Slicing potatoesRinse, peel and slice the potatoes thinly into rounds. Do not cut the potato slices too thin or transparent or thick. Using very thin potato slices will cause the pakoras to crisp up while frying and you want the potatoes to be soft and tender when cooked. Thick slices would make up for undercooked potato after being fried.Deep Frying Heat oil for frying in a kadai (wok) or pan on medium heat. The oil has to be medium-hot before you begin to fry. Dip each potato slice in the batter. Coat it evenly with the batter. Place the batter coated potato slice gently and carefully in the medium-hot oil.Batter coat 5 to 6 potato slices or more depending on the size of your pan and place them in the hot oil. When one side is light golden or golden, turn over the pakora with a slotted spoon. Fry the second side until crisp and golden. Turn over as needed a few times for even frying. Fry until golden and crispy. Using a slotted spoon remove them from oil and place on paper towels to remove excess oil.Fry the potato fritters in batches this way until golden and crisp. If you have leftover batter after frying all the potato slices, then slice more potatoes to use up the remaining batter. Serve aloo pakora hot or warm.Serving SuggestionsEnjoy aloo pakora with any of your favorite Indian dips like coriander chutney, tamarind chutney, mint chutney, coconut chutney, or ketchup.For a bright tangy flavor, sprinkle ½ to 1 teaspoon of chaat masala powder or a few pinches of black salt on the pakora. Serve these potato bajji as an evening snack with chai or coffee. I also serve these pakoras with the Mexican avocado dip guacamole and it is so yum. On occasions I make a pakora wrap filled with aloo pakora, guacamole and cilantro chutney. You could make burgers or sliders with these potato fritters or aloo bajji. I am sure you will love it with some mayonnaise, lettuce, cheese and ketchup. Pakora also pairs nicely with a raita. Make your favorite yogurt raita to serve these crispy fritters with. Storage and LeftoversPakoras are best eaten hot. After cooling they loose their crispy texture but the taste will be good. If you have leftover aloo pakoras, place them at room temperature for a few hours in a closed container or a covered bowl and try to eat them the same day.",NutritionCalories: 309kcal | Carbohydrates: 23g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 517mg | Potassium: 269mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 51IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 8mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 7mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 15mg | Magnesium: 3mg | Phosphorus: 6mg | Zinc: 1mg

Amchur Powder | Amchoor (Dry Mango Powder),https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amchur-powder-recipe-1-1-280x280.jpg,Made from scratch homemade Amchur Powder or Amchoor (also known as Dry Mango Powder) which is often added to North Indian recipes for a slight tang and sourness. Can be made in two ways – by sun drying or dehydrating in the oven.,15minutes,0minutes,21hours,1.0,Small Jar,Spices,North Indian,"Gluten Free, Vegan","▢ 3  mangoes raw, green, unripe, small-sized or 2 medium-sized mangoes","Prepare MangoesBefore you begin ensure to use clean and dry spoons, plates, tray, knife, peeler and grinder jar.Rinse and wipe the raw unripe mangoes completely dry.Peel the skin. This is the toughest part. Use a good sturdy peeler.With the same peeler, peel the mangoes into thin strips or chips.The strips or chips have to be thinly peeled. Peeling the mango flesh is easier than peeling the skin.Spread the thin peeled mango strips on a tray or a large plate.You can also use 2 to 3 trays or plates to make the drying easier.Two ways to dry the mangoesSun drying methodKeep the mango strips or chips in sun for few days. Usually it takes 2 to 3 days to dry them in the hot sun of North India. But the time can vary depending upon the sun duration and intensity.Oven methodHeat your oven to its minimum. Place the mango strips in the oven. Depending on the temperature it may take anywhere between 10 hours to 2 days or more.I heated the oven at 60 degrees Celsius and kept the mangoes to dry in the oven for 7 hours each, for three days. It took me about 21 hours for the mango strips to dry completely.In the night, I would keep the tray covered with a muslin in a dry place. After they are dried and dehydrated, the mango strips become crisp and snap easily like a thin potato wafer. As soon as they cool, powder them in the grinder.If you keep for more time after they have cooled, then some of the chips loose their crispness and get a chewy texture. Then, you will have to dry them again in the oven for a few hours till they become crisp.A few chips which may have been peeled thickly, may be thick and not crisp. But if they dry properly, they easily get powdered.Making amchur powderAs soon as the mango strips cool, add them to a dry grinder or spice grinder. Grind to a fine powder.Remove and store Amchur Powder or Dry Mango Powder in a jar. 3 small mangoes yielded 75 grams of Amchoor Powder. Store at room temperature in a clean dry glass jar or a BPA free plastic jar in a cool dry place. You can also store in a refrigerator.The homemade amchur powder keeps well for 6 months and if used and stored correctly can last for more than 6 months.Use Amchur Powder in your recipes, as required.

This is to get rid of any dampness or moisture in them.Also, sun dry fenugreek seeds and red chili powder for 4 to 5 hours. Meanwhile, soak the unripe mangoes in water for 1 hour. Then, rinse them well and if there is any sticky sap which has dried on the mangoes, rub the mangoes in your palms when rinsing to remove the dried sap.Remove the mangoes. Dry them with a clean kitchen towel or naturally.Chopping mangoesBefore chopping mangoes, they should be completely dry. There should not be any trace of moisture or water on the mangoes.Firstly, slice the mango in halves from its center. This is very difficult as the kernel is hard and the knife does not cut it easily. So please avoid, if you cannot do this chopping.Then, take each halve and remove the seeds carefully with a knife. The kernel part will be intact on the mangoes. Now, halve the mango vertically from the center first. Then, cut horizontally.This chopping is also difficult, so avoid if you cannot do this. The mango should be chopped into bite size pieces.Take the mango pieces and remove the thin paper like covering from the kernel part with a spoon or with your hands. Make sure that your hands are clean.Take the chopped mangoes in a large pan or bowl. Cover and keep aside.Making avakaya pachadiTake the mustard seeds.

Use cold pressed sesame oil (kachchi ghani) and not refined sesame oil. Mix very well and thoroughly with a large spoon.Storing avakaiCover with a lid (not tightly) and keep the mango Avakaya in a dry place for 4 to 5 days. You can also keep in sunlight for a few hours on 4 to 5 days. Alternatively, you can even add the mango mixture in a glass or ceramic jar.Everyday or alternate day, remove the lid and mix the pickle with a clean spoon. You can sun dry the spoon for some minutes before you mix the pickle.On the fourth or fifth day, you will see oil floating on top of the pickle and the mango pieces would have already softened. Mix again with a clean spoon.Add the pickle in a clean jar or bottle. Do wash the glass jar or bottle and then sun dry it for a day before storing the pickle. Pour some sesame oil in the pickle jars which just covers the pickle on top by 1.5 to 2 inches. Close the lid and refrigerate. You can even keep the pickle in a dry place for 2 to 3 days more and then refrigerate.Serving avakaya pachadiWhen serving avakai, remove the portion you want in a small jar from the main jar and then serve with your everyday meals.

This rustic, comforting recipe is a Punjabi classic, usually served hot with roti or paratha.",20minutes,10minutes,30minutes,2.0,,Side Dish,"Indian, North Indian, Punjabi","Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian",▢ 1 eggplant – large purple variety known as bhartha baingan in India (aubergine or brinjal)▢ ½ cup or 1 medium sized onions  – finely chopped▢ 1 cup or 2 medium sized tomatoes  – finely chopped▢ 1 heaped teaspoon garlic – finely chopped or 5 to 6 medium-sized garlic cloves▢ ½  teaspoon green chillies – chopped or serrano pepper▢ ¼ teaspoon Red Chili Powder or cayenne or add as required▢ 2 tablespoons oil – can use mustard oil or peanut oil or sunflower oil▢ 1 tablespoon coriander leaves – chopped (cilantro)▢ salt as required,"Roasting EggplantRinse the eggplant in water and then pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Cut the eggplant from its base up-to an inch away from the stem without breaking it apart.Cut on four sides or directions as shown in the step-by-step guide above. The eggplant has to be whole when you place it on the stove-top.Pull apart the cut sides gently and check for worms or any black spots. Discard the eggplant if you see any worms in it.If the eggplant looks clean and without worms, then proceed further. Optionally you can spread a light layer of oil all over it. Keep it for roasting on direct flame on the stove-top. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium.Note that as the eggplant cooks some of the juices and drippings will fall which you can wipe later. I don’t recommend placing or covering the sides of the stove-top burner with aluminum foil as they can burn and be dangerous.You can also grill the eggplant in the oven. But then do note that you won’t get the smoky flavor in the eggplant.Secure the eggplant between tongs and keep on turning it after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that it is evenly cooked.Roast the eggplant till its completely cooked and tender. With a fork or knife check the doneness. The knife should slide easily in aubergine without any resistance. Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools.Smoking Eggplant (Optional Step)You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the eggplant. This is an optional step. Use natural charcoal for this method. Carefully heat a small piece of charcoal on flame with the help of tongs or by placing it in a wired metal fire-proof rack above the flame, till it becomes smoking hot and red.Make small cuts on the roasted eggplant with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 1.5 minutes. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is cooked, just like the way we do for dal tadka.Whether you have charcoal smoked the eggplant or not, peel the charred skin when it cools. Chop finely or you can even mash it.Making Baingan ka BhartaIn a kadai or frying pan or skillet, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.Stirring often, sauté the onions till they soften and translucent. Don't brown them.Add chopped green chillies and chopped tomatoes. Mix well.Sauté the tomatoes stirring often, till the oil starts separating from the mixture.The tomatoes should become pulpy, soft and oil should release from the masala mixture. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix again.Add the chopped or mashed eggplant. Mix thoroughly.Season with salt. Stirring often saute for some 4 to 5 minutes on low to medium-low heat.Finally stir in the coriander leaves or garnish bharta with them. Serve baingan bharta with phulka, roti or chapati. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.You can also pair it with any North Indian meal or mains.

Cover the dough with a moistened napkin or kitchen towel and keep aside for 30 to 40 mins.Making potato stuffingSteam or boil the potatoes until they are fork tender and thoroughly cooked.When the potatoes become warm or cool, peel and chop them in small cubes. You can also add ⅓ cup steamed or boiled green peas to the filling.Crush the green chillies and ginger coarsely in a mortar-pestle.Heat 2 teaspoons oil in small frying pan. Add the cumin seeds and sauté till they splutter.Next add the crushed green chili and ginger paste. Mix well on low heat.Add the red chilli powder and coriander powder. Mix again.Now add the potato cubes. Mix the spices very well with the potatoes.Add garam masala powder, dry mango powder and salt as per taste.Mix everything again very well. Turn off the flame.Lastly add the chopped coriander leaves. Mix the coriander leaves with the aloo stuffing and set aside.Assembling and ShapingAfter 30 minutes, knead the dough lightly again.Divide the dough into 7 or 8 equal portions.Take a dough piece. Roll it on your palms to make a neat ball and place it on a rolling board.With a rolling pin, roll to a round or circle, keeping the thickness neither thin nor thick.Cut with a knife or a pastry cutter through the center of the samosa pastry.With a brush or with your finger tips, on the straight edge of the sliced dough, apply some water.Join the straight edge, overlapping the two edges a bit.Press the edges well, so that they get sealed. It will look like a cone.Now with a small spoon, stuff the potato filling in the cone. Pinch a part of the samosa cover and seal the base edges. This helps them to stand.Be sure there are no cracks. The edges should be joined very well.Making Baked SamosaAssemble and prepare all samosa this way. As you go on making them, cover them with a kitchen towel so that the outer pastry does not dry out.Before baking, preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for at least 15 minutes.Place the shaped and prepared samosa on a baking tray.Brush each samosa with some oil.Bake in a preheated oven at 180 degrees C/356 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp. I baked for 34 minutes. Oven temperatures vary so do keep a check.Allow them to cool down a bit for a couple of minutes as they will be very hot.When they are hot enough to eat, then serve the Baked Samosa with your favorite chutney or dip.",NutritionCalories: 114kcal | Carbohydrates: 14g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 6g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 273mg | Potassium: 71mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 51IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 2mg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 2µg | Calcium: 7mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 10µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 25mg | Phosphorus: 65mg | Zinc: 1mg

The Balushahi Sweet is popularly referred to as Badusha in South India.",10minutes,30minutes,40minutes,17.0,Balushahi,"Desserts, Sweets","Indian, North Indian, South Indian",Vegetarian,"For balushahi dough▢ 2  cups  all-purpose flour – 250 grams ▢ ¼  cup  Ghee – 60 grams, in a semi-solid state▢ ¼  cup  Curd – 60 grams▢ 8 to 9  tablespoons  cold water  for kneading or as required▢ 1  pinch  salt▢ 1  pinch  baking soda▢ ½  teaspoon  baking powder","Creaming gheeTake ¼ cup ghee in a bowl.With a spoon or spatula or a small wired whisk, beat the ghee till it is smooth, light and fluffy. Its color will also lighten.Add ¼ cup chilled fresh curd (dahi).Again with a spoon or spatula or a small wired whisk, mix and whip the curd with the creamed ghee.Cream till light and smooth.Making badusha doughNow using a sieve, take the all-purpose flour in it. Place it on the bowl itself. You can also sift the flour separately in a plate or tray.Add 1 pinch salt, 1 pinch baking soda and ½ teaspoon baking powder.Sift directly in the creamed ghee and curd.Mix the flour lightly with the creamed ghee and curd using  a spoon or spatula.Sprinkle some cold water in parts and begin to mix it. Overall you can use 8 to 9 tablespoons cold water. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water at a time and mix.Mix and combine everything to form a soft dough. Do not knead. Just mix and bring everything together to a dough. In case the dough becomes sticky, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Use light pressure from hands and form a dough. At this point, do not knead heavily or if required then knead very lightly.Cover the dough and keep aside for 15 minutes.Making sugar syrupMeanwhile make sugar syrup. While frying balushahi also you can make sugar syrup. Take 200 grams sugar or 1 heaped cup of sugar in a pan or bowl. Use a bowl or pan with more surface area so that the balushahi can get enough space for soaking.Add ½ cup water and mix.Place the pan on a low heat.Using a spoon stir the sugar so that it dissolves. If there are impurities in the sugar syrup, then add 1 tablespoon milk. Remove the scum that forms at the top.When all the sugar has dissolved, add ½ to 1 teaspoon green cardamom powder. Then add 10 to 12 saffron strands. Stir and mix again.Simmer the sugar solution on a low to medium-low heat. Do stir occasionally. To avoid crystallization of sugar, you can add some drops of lemon juice.Simmer till the syrup becomes sticky or you get ½ string consistency in the syrup. You can even cook it to 1 string consistency.The sugar syrup should be sticky. So cool syrup in a spoon and touch it and it should feels sticky. When the syrup becomes sticky, then switch off heat.Frying balushahiBefore frying balushahi you can begin to heat oil in a kadai or pan on a medium heat. You can also use ghee instead of oil to fry balushahi.Do use a kadai with handles at the sides. Pinch small to medium-sized balls from the dough. Roll them gently and lightly between your palms.Then make an indent or depression in them. You can flatten them slightly if you want. Make 5 to 6 badhusha depending on the size of kadai.Cover the remaining dough and keep aside. Check a tiny piece of the badhusha dough in the medium hot oil. It should come up gradually and steadily.Now lift the kadai from stove top and keep it on the kitchen table top. Gently begin to place balushahi in the hot oil.Be careful when you are keeping the balushahi in hot oil. Add 5 to 6 or 7 balushahi depending on the size of kadai. The badushah will expand in oil while frying, so make sure not to over crowd the kadai or pan.Now lift the kadai and place it again on a low heat.Begin to fry badusha on a low heat.When one side firms up and is light golden, turn over each badusha.Keep on turning them over at intervals and frying them on a low heat.Frying balushahi on a low flame takes about 12 to 15 minutes. This will depend on the size, thickness of kadai and the intensity of flame. It took me 14 minutes to fry each batch of 6 balushahi.Fry till golden and crisp.Using a slotted spoon remove them draining the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. When the first batch is getting fried, you can make balushahi from the dough and keep them ready to fry in the second round. Keep the shaped and prepared balushahi covered with a kitchen napkin. Then fry the second batch of balushahi in the same way.Making balushahiAfter a couple of minutes, when fried balushahi are still hot, place them in the hot or warm sugar syrup.With spoon or tongs turn over each badusha, so that both sides are coated with sugar syrup. Let these badusha soak in the sugar syrup for about 14 to 15 minutes.After 14 to 15 minutes, using tongs or spoon, lift each balushahi and place it in a serving tray or bowl. In the same sugar syrup, now add the second batch of balushahi.Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of pistachios all over. You can even sprinkle some saffron strand, rose petals and cardamom powder if you want. Press the pistachios, so that they stick to the sugar syrup on the badusha.Fry the remaining badusha and then soak them in the sugar syrup. In case if sugar syrup crystallizes then add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm or heat the syrup again on a low flame.Serve Balushahi as a sweet. Leftovers can be easily stored in an air-tight jar or container at room temperature for about 5 to 6 days.",NutritionCalories: 111kcal | Carbohydrates: 12g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 6g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.3g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 7mg | Sodium: 21mg | Potassium: 39mg | Fiber: 0.5g | Sugar: 0.3g | Vitamin A: 6IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 0.02mg | Vitamin B12: 0.01µg | Vitamin C: 0.1mg | Vitamin D: 0.004µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 0.2µg | Calcium: 13mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 27µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 5mg | Phosphorus: 30mg | Zinc: 0.1mg

First add ½ cup water and with a wired whisk begin to mix. If the batter looks thick, then add 1 to 3 tablespoons more water. Depending on the quality and texture of besan, you can add less or more water. Mix to a smooth flowing consistency in the batter. Break lumps if any while mixing batter.Cooking besan chillaHeat a frying pan or a skillet on a low to medium-low heat. You can use an iron skillet or a non-stick pan. If using iron skillet or tawa, then spread a bit of oil on it.Let the pan become medium hot. Then take a ladle full of the batter and pour on the panGently with the back of the ladle, begin to spread the batter.Spread lightly and gently so that the cheela does not break.On a low flame cook the chilla till the top begins to look cooked.Then drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon oil on the chilla at the edges and all around.Continue to cook till the base gets light golden.Flip and now cook the other side.Cook this side until you see golden spots on the besan chilla.Fold and serve chilla hot or warm. Besan chilla are best had hot. But if you are not able to serve them hot, then place them in a roti basket or casserole. They remain warm and can be served later.Serving suggestionsEnjoy besan chilla as it is or with a side dip of coriander chutney or mint chutney or any chutney of your choice or with tomato ketchup. You can serve it with plain curd (yogurt) or raita.We also like to have it with roti or bread. I sometimes make simple sandwiches stuffing the chilla between two bread slices spread with some coriander chutney and butter. You can make the besan chilla sandwich with toasted bread if you like. Storage Besan Chilla are best served hot and crisp as soon as they are made. They taste good when they become warm too. If I plan to serve them later in the day, I stack them in a steel box or a roti box which keeps them warm and moist. Make these as needed. I do not suggest to make a large batch for storage. On refrigeration the chilla becomes dry and lightly dense. Reheating them does not bring up the original flavors and they taste kind of dull.

This Punjabi style dry Stuffed Okra is also made without onion and garlic and a vegan recipe .",15minutes,20minutes,35minutes,2.0,,Side Dish,"North Indian, Punjabi",Vegan,"Main Ingredients ▢ 2 to 3 tablespoons oil – peanut oil or sunflower oil or any neutral flavored oil▢ 1 pinch asafoetida (hing), optional▢ 250 grams okra or 20 to 24 small to medium-sized bhindi","Preparing BhindiRinse the okra pods or bhindi in water very well using a colander or strainer. Drain all the water. Then wipe them dry with a kitchen towel. You can even keep them spread on a plate and let them dry naturally. The bhindi should be completely dry before you proceed with the second step.Slice of the crown part of each bhindi. This part is discarded. Then slice off the base tip. This part is also discarded.Next, with a knife give a slit on the bhindi without breaking it into two parts. The entire bhindi (okra) should be intact. With clean thumbs and fingers gently open the sliced part and check to see if there are any worms. If there are worms or black spots, then discard the bhindi.Repeat the above slicing steps with all of the bhindi. Making Stuffing MasalaCombine all the ground spices and salts listed under ""Ground Spices Stuffing"" section above except asafoetida in a bowl. Mix very well.Stuff the spice mix in each bhindi with a small spoon or with your fingers.Repeat with the entire lot of bhindi.Making bharwa bhindiTake a heavy pan or kadai (wok) large enough that can accommodate the okra in one single layer.Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in it. Keep heat to a low or medium-low and add 1 pinch asafoetida (hing). Stir and mix with oil. If you do not have asafoetida, then skip it.Then immediately add the stuffed bhindi in the oil and gently stir to combine with the oil.If any masala remains you can add it to the bhindi in the kadai. Also, add the masala which must have fallen on the chopping board while stuffing bhindi.Gently mix and stir again. Cook the stuffed bhindi on a low to medium-low heat.Do not cover the kadai with any lid as this can make the okra slimy. Let the bhindi cook on a low to medium-low heat. We don't want the masala to burn hence the bhindi needs to be cooked on a low to medium-low heat. Also do not add any water.The bhindi should not be on top of each other. Hence arrange them separately in a single layer on the kadai/pan, so that each bhindi is evenly cooked.Ensure that you check the bhindi in between and also give a gently stir after every 3 to 4 minutes. After giving a stir make sure each stuffed bhindi is arranged separately in a single layer. This helps in even cooking.Slow cook until the bhindi is tender and well cooked. At this point, check taste of bhindi and if the salt is less then sprinkle some salt from above and stir to combine.Final TouchesTake the kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) in your palms. Crush kasuri methi between your palms, and sprinkle on the bhindi.If you do not have kasuri methi, then skip adding.Also add garam masala powder. Mix very well and turn off the heat.Lastly, add the chopped coriander leaves and mix again. Instead of coriander leaves you can also use mint leaves.Serving SuggestionsServe Bharwa Bhindi hot or warm, with roti and yogurt or raita. It also goes well with a combination of dal and rice.You can garnish it with coriander leaves while serving. You can even squeeze lime or lemon on the Stuffed Bhindi before you serve.",NutritionCalories: 192kcal | Carbohydrates: 14g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 15g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 12g | Sodium: 609mg | Potassium: 459mg | Fiber: 6g | Sugar: 2g | Vitamin A: 1213IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.3mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.3mg | Vitamin C: 30mg | Vitamin E: 7mg | Vitamin K: 42µg | Calcium: 139mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 76µg | Iron: 2mg | Magnesium: 86mg | Phosphorus: 97mg | Zinc: 1mg

Keep the sugar solution on stove top on a low heat.Cook the sugar syrup, till you get a one thread consistency. Stir often. Switch off the heat. Set the sugar solution aside.The sugar syrup should be hot when you add the boondi. So you can keep the sugar solution on a hot water bath by place the pan on a plate or tray filled with hot water. You can choose to fry the boondi and prepare the sugar solution side by side.Making and frying boondiTake the dry ingredients for the boondi batter in a mixing bowl – gram flour and crushed saffron or saffron powder.Add water to make a smooth batter. The consistency of the batter is important. We will check if the consistency is right, by frying a few boondis.Tap the wired whisk or the handle of a spoon which has a bit of batter in to the hot oil. The boondis should have a round shape.If they become flat, the batter is thin and if they get tail ends, the batter is thick.TIP 1: If thin, then add a bit of gram flour and check by frying a few boondi. TIP 2: If thick, then add a bit of water and then do the same test. Once you get the correct consistency, proceed with the next step of frying the boondi.Take a dry perforated ladle and place it above the hot oil. Don't keep the ladle too much on a height, as the batter droplets, when falling from a height, do not give a round shape.With a spoon add some batter on the perforated spoon ladle.Spread the batter lightly with a spoon. Finish up the batter on the perforated spoon ladle this way.Fry the boondi till they are cooked. Don't make them crisp or over do the frying. When the oil stops sizzling, remove the boondi.This step is also important because if boondi becomes crisp then the boondi ladoo won’t be soft and they won’t be able to absorb the sugar syrup.After each batch, wipe the perforated ladle with a clean piece of kitchen towel from both sides.Making Boondi LadduStrain the fried boondi well with a slotted spoon and then add them directly to the hot sugar syrup. Fry all the boondi in batches with the above method and then add them to the sugar syrup.Finally add melon seeds (magaz), cardamom powder, black cardamon seeds, ghee and a pinch of edible camphor (optional). Mix well and shape the boondi mixture into a small to medium-sized round spherical ball. If you are not able to shape them, then add 1 to 2 tablespoon more ghee as it helps in binding.You can place the boondi ladoo in a small muffin liners. You can also garnish them with raisins or cashews or slivered nuts like almonds or pistachios.Serve boondi laddu. If not serving the same day, refrigerate them in an airtight container.

Grind to a semi-fine consistency and do not make it floury or powdery. Take the bread crumbs in a plate or bowl. Keep aside. Skip this part if you have breadcrumbs. Preparing veggiesNow rinse and steam or boil 3 medium to large potatoes, 1 medium carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓ cup peas till they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the vegetables in a stove-top pressure cooker, Instant Pot or a pan. I have listed the methods below. 1: Stove-top pressure cooker: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots and beans. Place them with the green peas in a pan or bowl. Add 2 cups water in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Place a small trivet inside. Place the bowl with the veggies on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes on medium-heat. Let the pressure fall naturally in the cooker and then only remove the lid.2: Instant pot cooking: Pour 1.5 cups water in the steel insert of 6 quart IP. Keep a trivet inside the steel insert. Place the whole potatoes, carrots, beans in a steamer pan or on the trivet. Take green peas in a small bowl and place it on the steamer pan or on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes until veggies are tender. Let the pressure release naturally. 3: Cooking in a pan: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots in small cubes. Chop the beans to small pieces. Place the chopped veggies and green peas in a pan. Add water just about covering the vegetables. Cover and simmer on medium-low flame until veggies are fork tender. Peel and roughly chop the potatoes when warm. Also peel the cooked carrots and finely chop them. Finely chop the french beans too.Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.When the mashed potatoes cools down completely, add the chopped carrots and beans. Also add the steamed peas.Mix everything well and keep aside.Then finely chop the onion and crush garlic, ginger and green chilies in a mortar-pestle. Set aside. You can crush them together or separately.Making vegetable patty mixtureHeat 1 teaspoon oil in a pan. Add the ginger-garlic-green-chili paste. Sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger and garlic goes away.Add the chopped onions. Stir and saute till the onion turns translucent or light brown.Add coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, red chili powder or cayenne pepper and turmeric powder.Stir and mix the spices with the rest of the mixture.Switch off the flame and then add the chopped coriander leaves or parsley.Stir very well and add this sauteed onion mixture to the mashed veggies.Add salt and bread crumbs. Begin to mix very well.Keep the veggie patty mixture aside. Check the seasonings and add more of the ground spices and salt if needed.Make the veggie patties as same as the size of the burger buns. Keep aside. If the mixture looks soft or crumbles, then do add some more breadcrumbs and mix everything again very well. Cover the veggie patties and set aside.Preparing mayo dressing and toppingsTake mayonnaise in a small mixing bowl.Add ground mustard seed and freshly crushed black pepperAdd lemon juice. You can also lemon juice as per your taste.Add apple cider vinegar or white vinegar and extra virgin olive oil or olive oil.Season with sugar. Also add saltWhisk the dressing very well. Keep aside.Also chop onion, tomato and cucumber in thin slices. Shred or chop some 4 to 5 small lettuce leaves or cabbage leaves.Making batterIn a medium sized mixing bowl take add makki ka atta, polenta or cornmeal , rice flour and gram flour (besan) or chickpea flour. Instead of gram flour & rice flour, you can also use 2 tbsp of all purpose flour.Add water. Stir and mix everything to a smooth batter without any lumps. The batter is of medium consistency. Keep aside.Pan frying patties Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil for pan frying the patties in a bowl. When the oil becomes medium hot, dip the patty in the batter.Coat evenly with the batter.Place the batter coated vegetable patty on the breadcrumbs. Dredge the patty evenly with the breadcrumbs. You can repeat the breading method twice for more crispiness.Place the breaded veggie patty in the medium hot oil. Bread another veggie patty in the same way and place it also in the pan. Depending on the size of your pan, you can fry from 2 to 4 patties. The veggie mixture makes 4 regular burger sized patties.2 to 3 tablespoons oil works perfectly for frying two patties. For 4 veggie patties, you can add 4 to 6 tablespoons oil. When the base is lightly browned or browned, then flip the patties.Flip a couple of times more till the patties are pan fried evenly and the crust becomes crisp and golden.Drain the veggie patties on kitchen paper towels.Assembling veggie burgerSlice the burger buns in equal halves.Spread some butter on the burger bun slices.Heat a small pan and toast the butter side.The buttered side should become lightly crisp and golden. Toast all the burger buns this way.Now spread the mayonnaise dressing on the crisp side.Place the vegetable patty.Top up with sliced veggies like onion slices, tomato slices or cucumber slices.Spread some mayonnaise dressing on the second halve of the burger bun and top up with some shredded or chopped lettuce or cabbage leaves.Place the burger buns on top of each other.Your veggie burger is ready. Make all veg burgers this way.Serving suggestionsOnce your veggie burgers are assembled, serve them immediately with tomato ketchup, mustard sauce and some French Fries or Potato Wedges.If you don’t have tomatoes and cucumbers, sliced avocado or Guacamole works as a great topping as well. Or you can use grated carrots or coleslaw as a topping alternative. These veggie burgers are great snacks, but they are also filling enough to be a tasty lunch too.

This will stop cooking of the rice.Cover and keep the rice aside till it cools at room temperature. The rice has to be completely cooled at room temperature before you add it to the stir fried veggies.Making garlic fried riceNow rinse and then chop finely all the veggies. You can use your choice of veggies.In a well seasoned wok or kadai, heat sesame oil.Add finely chopped garlic. On a low heat, begin to stir fry the garlic.First the garlic would start turning light brown and then become golden.When the garlic turns golden, remove 1 to 2 teaspoon of the garlic and keep aside.

If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot.When the oil is hot enough, press holding the chakli maker directly on top of the oil and let the murukku directly fall in the oil.Do not over crowd the kadai with murukku. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai.Fry till they are half done or have become slightly crisp.

The more light and softer the consistency, the better the chhena poda tastes.I have not added any milk or water. In case the mixture looks dry, then you can add a few tablespoons of milk or water. Some amount of fat is released while mashing chenna and thats fine.Once you get a cake batter like consistency in the paneer mixture, then add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder and ½ tablespoon rice flour. Optionally a pinch of baking soda can also be added, but does not make any difference. Instead of rice flour, you can also use fine rava (sooji).

Find the details below.Cooking in a pot or pan: Take the soaked rice and 2 cups of water in a pan. Cover and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until rice grains are tender and the water has been absorbed. If the most of the water has evaporated and the rice grains look undercooked, add a few tablespoons of hot water. Cover and continue to cook rice.Cooking in Instant Pot: Transfer the rice grains and 1.5 cups water in the Instant Pot. Seal the lid and position the valve to sealing. Pressure cook on high pressure for 4 to 5 minutes. When the cooking is complete and you hear the beep sound, wait for 5 minutes before giving a quick pressure release. Open the lid and transfer the rice to a tray or plate for cooling.When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and fluff the rice. For a softer texture in the rice, pressure cook for 3 whistlesTake the rice in a plate/tray and allow to cool grains completely. You can also cool the rice in the cooker itself. If there are lumps in the rice, then break the lumps once the rice is cooled.Making temperingHeat coconut oil in a pan. You can also use sesame oil or any other neutral oil. Reduce the heat to a low. Crackle mustard seeds first in the hot oil. Add the chana dal and urad dal. Stir and fry for about a minute.Then add chopped cashews.Stir and fry till the cashews turn golden. The lentils would also turn golden by then.Add red chilies, curry leaves and chopped green chilies along with a pinch of asafetida.Stir and fry until the red chilies change color and the curry leaves become crisp.Making coconut riceNext add grated coconut. Mix very well.Sauté the coconut for 3 to 4 minutes stirring often. The coconut can be sautéed until it get a cream-ish color or a faint light beige color.Lastly add the steamed rice and salt.Combine and mix the rice well. Switch off the heat.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe coconut rice hot or warm. If you like you can garnish with chopped coriander leaves and drizzling with a bit of ghee while serving. You can also choose to drizzle some lemon juice on the rice while eating.You can serve coconut rice as is or pair with a gravy or curry like vegetable stew, potato roast, vegetable kurma, cauliflower kurma, potato curry or moong lentils curry or a simple dal and even plain homemade fresh curd or yogurt. I suggest pairing with gravy or curry for a really flavorful meal. Accompany some papadum (appalam) if you like.Since this rice has coconut, it is best had fresh. I do not recommend to store this rice in the fridge as the chances of coconut going rancid are very high. Moreover it is best to eat rice when freshly cooked.

You can also add 1 teaspoon of roughly chopped ginger if you want.Add water in parts and grind all the ingredients to a smooth fluffy batter. On touching the batter, it should not feel grainy. I added 6 to 7 tablespoons of water.Depending on the quality of lentils and the capacity-volume of grinder, you can add less or more water. Don't add too much water as then the fritters become too crispy and soak a lot of oil.Take the ground batter in a bowl and add salt.Stir the batter briskly for a couple of minutes. This brisk stirring makes the batter more light and fluffy.The test to a correct consistency of this batter is the floating test. Take some water in a small bowl. Add 1 tsp of a batter in the water. The batter should float. If it does not float, this means the consistency is thin. Add some sooji or rice flour to the batter to thicken it.Frying bhalla and soaking in waterHeat a kadai or pan with oil for deep frying.When the oil becomes medium hot, add a small amount of batter in the oil. It should come steadily and quickly on the surface. This means it is the right temperature to fry. Too cold oil will make the fritters soggy with oil and too high will brown them faster from outside, leaving the center uncooked.Add spoonfuls of the batter in the oil. Add according to the capacity of the pan or kadai.When they become pale golden, then turn them.Fry the fritters till they become golden and crispy. Turn them a couple of times for even frying.Fry till golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon.Drain on paper towels. Fry all the bhallas in the same way.Once all the bhallas are done with frying, then take 2.5 cups water in a wide bowl or pan.And add the bhallas to the water.

Now you can keep the bhallas with the curd in the fridge and assemble when you want to serve. Or use them right away as the curd is chilled.Gather and assemble all your other ingredients like – boiled potato cubes, boiled white chickpeas, green chutney, tamarind chutney, pomegranate arils and the spice powders.To make individual portions of dahi bhalla, place 4 to 5 papdis in a plate.Place 2 to 3 bhalla with the the curd in a plate.

Dahi ke Kabab (Yogurt Kebab),https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dahi-ke-kabab-recipe-280x280.jpg,"This is a traditional Dahi Kabab recipe that makes for a crisp, soft and tasty kababs. These Dahi ke Kabab are made with curd or yogurt, gram flour, onions, ginger, chilies, coriander leaves and spices.",8hours,15minutes,8hours,6.0,Dahi Kabab,Snacks,North Indian,"Gluten Free, Vegetarian","▢ 1.5  cups  Curd – 375 grams curd or 200 grams hung curd, about 8 to 9 tablespoons hung curd or greek yogurt – fresh and cold▢ 5  tablespoons  gram flour (besan)▢ 2  tablespoons  finely chopped onions▢ ½  teaspoon  finely chopped ginger▢ ½  teaspoon  finely chopped green chillies▢ 1  tablespoon  finely chopped coriander leaves▢ ½  teaspoon  Cumin Powder (ground cumin)▢ ½  teaspoon  Garam Masala▢ ¼  teaspoon  black pepper powder (ground black pepper) or white pepper powder▢ ½  teaspoon  salt  or add as required▢ 2  tablespoons  oil – for pan frying or add as needed","Preparing hung curdFirst keep a strainer on top of a deep bowl. Line a muslin or a cotton napkin on the strainer. Add the fresh cold curd. The curd has to be thick and creamy and not watery or thin.Bring the edges of the muslin together and tie one edge tightly around the rest. Place a heavy weight or heavy bowl or lid on the tied muslin. Next day, the whey will be drained and there will be thick and creamy hung curd. With the nutrient rich whey, you can add it to chapati dough or make pulao or curries with it. Now remove the hung curd in a mixing bowl. Use silicon spatula as scraping the curd is easier with it. Set aside or you can keep covered in the fridge till you proceed further.Preparing kabab mixtureHeat a heavy pan or kadai. Add 5 tablespoons besan in it. You can also add 6 tablespoons besan if you are making these kababs for the first time and for easier shaping.Begin to stir and roast the gram flour on a low heat till it becomes fragrant and changes color. It is important to roast the gram flour well, so that you do not get the raw taste of gram flour after frying the kababs. However, do not make the gram flour too browned.Roast for 4 to 5 minutes on a low heat stirring non-stop till the gram flour becomes fragrant and turns golden. Set aside.Take the hung curd in a bowl. Then add finely chopped onions, finely chopped ginger, finely chopped green chillies and finely chopped coriander leaves.Add cumin powder and garam masala powder. You can even use roasted cumin powder.Add the roasted besan and black pepper powder (or white pepper powder).Instead of black pepper powder you can even use ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder. Crushed black pepper can also be added.With a small wired whisk, begin to stir and mix. Do mix very well so that there are no tiny lumps of the besan. When mixing I suggest to use a wired whisk as the lumps break easily. If you use a spoon or spatula, then its takes time to break them. With a silicon spatula, scrape the sides and bring the entire kabab mixture in the center. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Refrigerating makes the kabab mixture firm and thus shaping them is easier.Making dahi kababBefore frying heat 2 tablespoons oil on a skillet or frying pan. Keep the flame to low or medium-low.Now spread a bit of water on both palms and take a portion of the kabab mixture and give it a round shape.Then flatten it. Do not make thick kababs. If you are unable to make kababs, then keep in the fridge for some more time.Place the dahi kabab in the hot oil. Keep the flame to low or medium-low. Make kababs from the entire mixture and place them in the oil.Let the dahi kabab become golden from the bottom and then only flip them. These kabab get browned faster, so do keep an eye while pan frying.When the base is golden, then turn over the dahi kabab. Fry the second side also till golden.Turn over a couple of times and fry till you get a nice golden even crust on both sides. A slight more browning of the kabab is also fine.Remove the pan fried dahi ke kabab and place them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.Serve dahi kabab hot with sprinkled with some chaat masala.

Stir again and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.Add the chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute.Add the prepared tomato puree and mix well.Add red chili powder and 2 to 3 pinches of grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder.Mix very well and sauté this mixture on a low to medium flame, till you see fat releasing from the sides.Add the cooked lentils and kidney beans together with the stock. Also add 1 cup water or as needed.Slow CookingMix very well and simmer the dal makhani uncovered on a low heat.Keep on stirring often, so that the lentils don’t stuck to the bottom of the pan.Once it has begun to thicken, add salt as required.Stir very well and continue to simmer on a low heat. Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmering on low heat.When simmering you can add more water if the consistency looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low heat. Do keep on stirring at intervals.When the consistency has thickened enough, add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.Mix the cream very well. Then turn off the heat.Add crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi and mix again. Cover with a lid and set the Dal Makhani aside, if you are proceeding to the dhungar method. Or else you can serve Dal Makhani straightaway.Dhungar Method (Optional)Turn on the stovetop and set the flame to low or medium-low heat. Place a flameproof wire rack with a handle on the stove. I typically use a round metal rack as shown in the step-by-step image above.Keep a small piece of charcoal on the rack and heat it directly over the flame until it becomes hot. Use steel tongs to rotate the charcoal, ensuring it burns evenly.Be cautious while doing this, and if you're unsure, it's okay to skip this step altogether.Keep the red hot charcoal in a small bowl.Pour ½ teaspoon oil on the hot charcoal.Immediately keep this bowl on top of the dal makhani.Cover for a minute and allow the charcoal to infuse its smoke in the dal makhni. Remove the bowl. Stir again. Serve Punjabi Dal Makhani garnished with chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and a few teaspoons of cream with naan, roti, paratha or steamed rice.",NutritionCalories: 308kcal | Carbohydrates: 35g | Protein: 13g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Cholesterol: 35mg | Sodium: 433mg | Potassium: 353mg | Fiber: 12g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 987IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 17mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 7µg | Calcium: 61mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 60µg | Iron: 4mg | Magnesium: 31mg | Phosphorus: 77mg | Zinc: 1mg

Mix well so that everything combines to an even consistency. Taste and adjust salt before adding tadka.Smoke lentils using dhungar method (optional)To get the smoky flavor of burnt charcoal like you would in a restaurant, you'll want to follow the dhungar method. Using tongs, place a small piece of charcoal on a grill pan like shown in the photo below. Burn the charcoal until it becomes red hot. Please be sure to use natural charcoal for this method, avoiding anything that has a flame accelerant added. Note that this is an optional step – you can proceed directly to the tempering method.Place the red hot charcoal in a small steel bowl. You can also use a halved hollow onion instead of the bowl.Pour about ¼ teaspoon of oil or ghee on the charcoal. You will see fumes emanating as soon as you pour oil or ghee on the hot charcoal.Place this bowl on the dal.Cover the cooker or pot with a lid and let the dal get infused. Only smoke for 1 to 2 minutes. Do not keep for a long time, or you'll risk making the dal taste bitter. Remove the bowl carefully with the help of tongs and cover the cooker with a lid.

The khoya used for jamuns is the soft khoya also known as daap ka khoya or chikna khoya. This is a soft khoya, so it mashes and kneads very well.Mash the khoya very well with your hands. Keep aside. There should be no lumps or small bits or pieces in the khoya. You can also grate and then mash the khoya. Also, the mashed khoya should not feel granular.Grate the paneer and keep aside. 100 grams paneer yields about ½ cup grated paneer. Use a fine grater to grate the paneer.Now add the grated paneer and all-purpose flour (maida) to the mashed khoya.Add milk. Gently mix everything very well.Bring together this mixture and form into a dough. Do not knead the dough. Just mix and gather to a dough. If the mixture looks dry and does not cling together to a dough, you can add 1 tablespoon more of the milkNow pinch small marble sized balls from the dough and roll them in a round shape between your palms. Roll lightly and not heavily.Roll all the jamuns this way and keep them covered with a cotton kitchen towel.Making sugar syrupTake the sugar in a pan and add water.Keep this pan on stove top on a low to medium heat and stir so that the sugar begins to dissolve.When all the sugar is dissolved, add lemon juice. The lemon juice does not allow the sugar syrup to crystallize.Cook the sugar syrup on a low to medium heat till you get ½ string consistency or the syrup becomes sticky.Switch off the heat and add green cardamom powder, crushed saffron strands and rose water.Frying dry jamunWhen the sugar syrup is cooking, you can begin frying the jamuns. As when you add the fried jamuns, the sugar syrup needs to be hot. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep pan on a low to medium heat.For testing, slid a tiny dough ball in the hot oil. The ball should come up slowly and not quickly. This is the temperature at which we will fry the jamuns.Keep the heat to a low and fry this tiny jamun ball.Fry this small jamun till it becomes golden. If this jamun ball breaks, then add a few teaspoons of flour to the dough and mix well again. Before you begin shaping the jamuns, you can do this test.Now gently slid the jamuns. The heat should be low. Do not crowd and add the jamuns as per the size of the pan.When you see light golden spots, turn over the jamuns gently. The jamuns fry very quickly, so do be attentive.Keep on turning them in the oil, like a gentle swirling with the slotted spoon, so that they brown evenly.When frying the jamuns have to feel light and not heavy.Fry till they turn golden from all sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to remove excess oil.Making Dry Gulab JamunWhilst they are hot, quickly add them to the sugar syrup. Fry all the jamuns in the same way and add them to the sugar syrup. Note that the sugar syrup has to be hot. To maintain the hot temperature, you can keep the sugar syrup bowl or pan on a hot water bath. Cover and allow the jamuns to soak in the sugar syrup for about 2 hours.After 2 hours, gently strain the jamuns from the sugar syrup.Then take each jamun and roll it in a small plate consisting of 2 to 3 tablespoons of fine or superfine granulated sugar or 2 to 3 tablespoons of desiccated coconut.Roll them well, so that the sugar or desiccated coconut coats evenly. Place dry jamuns in a bowl or container. Close with a lid and refrigerate.Serve dry jamuns as a dessert or sweet.

Cover them with a lid or a kitchen towel so that they do not become dry.On a wooden board spread oil very lightly. Now with the heels of your palms, with a light pressure and force, press and flatten the dough ball and at the same time move the palms forward. If you apply too much pressure then fafda will stick to board and will break while lifting. This is the only tricky part in the whole recipe. You will get a long elongated shaped fafda. Gently pick it up from the board. An alternate method is to roll a large piece of dough with a rolling pin (belan) on a greased rolling board (chakla). Then with a knife cut strips and remove them.Keep it on a separate plate which has been greased lightly with oil. Make fafda this way with the remaining dough balls. Cover with a kitchen napkin so that they do not become dry.frying fafdaHeat oil in a kadai. When the oil becomes medium hot, check a small tiny piece of the dough.

Do not fry till too much browned.

Take the potatoes in a mixing bowl.Mash the potatoes with a potato masher or fork very well. Allow the mashed potatoes to cool at room temperature.Once the mashed potatoes have come to room temperature, then add arrowroot flour and salt. Since these patties are made during fasting I have arrowroot flour. You can also add buckwheat flour or water chestnut flour if making for fasting. If making for regular days, then add corn starch, rice flour or bread crumbs.Mix the arrowroot flour with the mashed potatoes very well and lightly knead the mixture.Cover and keep aside the potato dough.Making Farali Stuffing Then heat a small pan and add peanuts.Roast the peanuts stirring often on a low flame till they become crunchy and have a few black spots on them.

Make these homemade french fries or finger chips recipe easily with a few techniques and customize it with your favorite herbs and spices or toppings.",5minutes,25minutes,30minutes,2.0,,"Snacks, Starters",World,"Gluten Free, Vegan","▢ 315 grams potatoes or 3 medium-sized or 2 large – russet, idaho, yukon gold or maris piper▢ 3.5 cups cold water▢ oil for deep frying – as required▢ ½ teaspoon dried rosemary or dried oregano or mixed herbs – as required▢ ½  teaspoon Red Chili Powder or paprika or cayenne pepper as required – optional▢ salt as required, can use black salt or edible rock salt or pink salt","Prepping PotatoesFirstly take the potatoes and rinse well in water. Then peel them. Then slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness. Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato.Then begin to cut them in sticks having 1 cm width. Rinse these potato sticks for a couple of times in water to get rid of the extra starch. Soaking PotatoesIn a bowl take 3.5 cups cold water and place the potatoes in it. Keep this bowl outside or in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 45 minutes. In a hot and humid climate keep the bowl in the fridge.After 30 minutes or 45 minutes, drain the potatoes in a colander.Rinsing and Drying Potato SticksRinse the potatoes in clean fresh water using a colander or mesh strainer. Drain all the water. Then place them on clean kitchen cotton napkin.Fold the napkin above and press, pat and dry the potatoes. The potatoes have to be completely dried before you begin to fry them. First FryingHeat oil in a wok or pan over medium-low or medium heat. For a heavy pan, keep medium heat and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low heat. The oil should have a temperature of 135 degrees Celsius (275 degrees Fahrenheit).Now, working in batches, add the potatoes to the oil. Do not overcrowd the wok (kadai) or pan with the potatoes. The oil will sizzle and bubble less when you fry the potatoes at this temperature.Stir at intervals while frying them for uniform cooking.Fry/blanch in oil for about 3 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not brown from outside. They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.Place the half fried potatoes on paper kitchen towels. Stack 3 to 4 paper towels. Press some paper towels from top also to absorb extra oil. Let the half fried potatoes cool down at room temperature. Note that after removing this batch, you can fry the second batch of potatoes. By the time you fry the second batch of the potatoes, the first batch will cool down. So even though you have to fry twice, you’re using the same batch of oil all the way through. Second FryingNow increase the heat to a medium-high or high. Again here for a heavy pan, use a high heat and for a less heavy pan, use medium-high heat. The oil should be hot on medium-high to high heat having a temperature of 180 to 185 degrees celsius (356 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit).Add the first batch of once-fried potatoes to the hot oil. The oil will sizzle and bubble quickly and as soon as you add the potatoes.Stir often while the potatoes fry to cook them evenly. Fry french fries for 3 minutes or until crisp and golden. The edges should become golden. Remove with a slotted spoon.Place french fries on paper tissues again to remove the extra oil.Making Air Fried French FriesAfter drying them thoroughly, mix and coat the potato sticks with 2 tablespoons oil. Take a batch and line the sticks evenly in the air-fryer basket. You can also line the potatoes on a parchment paper in the basket. Before air-frying, preheat the air-fryer at 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 to 6 minutes.Place the air-fryer basket with the potato sticks in the air-fryer. Air-fry for about a total time of 10 to 12 minutes.Half way through after about 5 to 6 minutes, shake the basket or turn over each fry with tongs or a spoon. Air fry again for 5 to 6 minutes until golden.Remove the air-fried fries in a bowl. Work in batches this way and make air-fryer french fries.Serving SuggestionsWhile still hot, take the french fries (whether deep fried or air-fried) in a bowl. Sprinkle with some salt, paprika or red chili flakes, dried herbs or dry rosemary. You can add your choice of herbs and spices.Gently shake and toss the bowl so that the salt, herbs mix evenly with the friesServe these homemade french fries hot with any dip or sauce of your choice.Tomato ketchup and Cilantro Chutney are our favorite dips to go with french fries. We also like to serve with some Eggless Mayonnaise.Make Ahead and StorageFor freezing and storing french fries in large quantities, fry/blanch the potatoes in hot oil first for about 3 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Wipe the extra oil with kitchen paper towels and when cooled, line the half-fried potatoes on a tray. Cover the tray with a kitchen napkin and freeze for an hour. Remove the frozen fries from the tray and transfer to a zip-lock bag or a container and store in your freezer.Now you can deep fry, bake or air-fry these frozen fries. When cooking the fries with any of these methods, you do not need to thaw the frozen finger chips. While deep frying, heat oil until medium or medium-high hot and deep fry the fries until golden and crisp. Sprinkle salt or ground spices, herbs and serve straight away. Remove and add in salt and herbs.

Stir, mix and fry them in the oil for 3 to 4 minutes or until pale golden. Do not brown garlic, as the cloves become dense and chewy when pickled. They should only be partially cooked.Place pan on countertop. The oil will stop sizzling gradually. Add Spices and SaltFirst add the coarsely ground mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds. Add fennel seeds and nigella seeds (kalonji).Then add the turmeric powder, asafoetida (hing), Kashmiri red chili powder and edible food grade rock salt or pink salt. TIP: If using red chili powder or cayenne start by adding 1 to 1.5 teaspoons as it can make for a spicy pickle. Instead of Kashmiri red chili powder, you can also use sweet paprika. For the salt, start with 1 teaspoon. Mix well and check taste. If needed, add ½ to 1 teaspoon more salt. TIP: If using regular white salt, you will need to add less – about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons total. Asafoetida is optional and you could skip adding. Check the notes section below for more info. Mix and combine very well.Add 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or white vinegar. Mix well. Check taste and, if needed, add more salt or red chili powder. Pickle GarlicTransfer pickle to a clean, dry, sterilized glass or ceramic jar.Lastly, cover the top layer of pickle with 3 tablespoons mustard oil. The oil should be at room temperature.Tightly cover garlic pickles with lid and place in sunlight for 2 to 3 days. Lightly shake the jar everyday without opening the lid.I keep the jar on a window sill which gets plenty of sunlight. If you do not get sunlight, place it in a dry place in your kitchen, though the flavor will not be as intense as the sunlight steeped achaar.Storage After the pickling process is over, place the jar in a dark, dry place. At room temperature, this garlic pickle stays good for about 2 weeks.If you have any pickle remaining after 2 weeks, refrigerate it. Or you could keep it in the refrigerator all the time. It stays good in the refrigerated for about a month. If the top oil layer is removed as you eat the pickles, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of mustard oil again to cover the top layer. This will prevent the cloves from coming into contact with air and spoiling.Serving SuggestionsRemove the pickle with a clean dry spoon every time. Do not add water logged spoon into the pickle. Serve about ½ to 1 teaspoon of the garlic pickle with any Indian main course meal for one. This pickle tastes good with any Indian lunch or dinner be it North, South, East or Western Indian. We like it with a simple Khichdi, Dal Fry served with basmati rice, Sambar and rice, or Pulao. I also like to have it with Paratha, Aloo Paratha and Gobi Paratha.",NutritionCalories: 28kcal | Carbohydrates: 1g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 2g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 120mg | Potassium: 19mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 30IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 8mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 2mg | Phosphorus: 7mg | Zinc: 1mg

Also add 1/2 cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal.Grind the urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula.Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. I ground in one batch and added 1 cup water for grinding. You can even add 3/4 cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it.

You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter.making ghee roast dosaNow heat a thick bottomed cast iron griddle or non stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. You can keep the flame to a low or medium while making dosas. If using an iron pan, then spread ¼ to ½ tsp oil/ghee all over the pan. Use a silicon brush or spoon or kitchen towel or an onion halve to spread the oil/ghee. Do not spread oil/ghee on a non stick pan. Do keep the flame on low to low-medium flame, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium. Pour a ladle of the batter in the center.With the ladle gently spread the batter to get a neat round shape and a thin dosa.If the pan is very hot, you won’t be able to spread the batter in a round circle. So for a nonstick pan, just lift the pan from the flame and keep outside for some seconds or half a minute. Then again place it on the fire. For a iron griddle, you can sprinkle some water on the pan. This reduces the temperature of the cast iron griddle. Please do not sprinkle water on non stick pan. The non stick coating can wear off.On a medium flame, cook the dosa.When the top looks cooked, sprinkle 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ghee at the sides and on the top of dosa. You can add less or more ghee as per your requirements.Now with the spoon spread the ghee all over.Keep cooking till you see the base becoming golden.The more the base becomes golden, the dosa becomes more crisp.Fold and serve ghee roast dosa hot.Ghee roast dosa can be served with coconut chutney or a combination of coconut chutney and sambar.",

Drain the water. Rinse the dried peas a few times again with fresh water. Drain all the water and set the soaked peas aside.Making GhugniPlace a 3 litre pressure cooker on the stovetop.Keep heat low or medium-low.When the oil becomes shot, add cinnamon, cardamom, tej patta, dry red chilli and cloves. At this point you can also add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds if you do not add cumin powder later.Allow the spices to crackle on low to medium-low heat ensuring they do not burn.Add in the finely chopped onions. Sauté until onions are softened or a light golden.Add ginger garlic paste and sauté for about 20 to 30 seconds on a low heat or until their raw aroma dissipates.Add the finely chopped tomatoes and sauté for about 2 minutes on medium-low to medium heat.Next add the ground spices – Kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder.Mix thoroughly and sauté until the onion-tomato masala looks glossy with the tomatoes softened completely. You will also see a bit of oil separating at the sides.If the masala starts sticking onto the cooker, add a splash of water and mix. It is important that the ground spices cook well.Add the soaked and rinsed peas, chopped potatoes and season with sugar and add salt according to taste.Stir and mix to combine.Add water and mix again.Let this mixture simmer for 2 to 3 minutes on medium-low heat.Seal the cooker tightly with its lid and pressure cook for 15 minutes on medium heat.Once the pressure drops naturally in the cooker, then only open the lid.Check if the peas have softened well. Also check the consistency of the ghugni.If the peas are al dente or undercooked, pressure cook again for 5 minutes or more. Add water if needed when pressure cooking the second time.If the consistency is runny, keep the cooker on stovetop and simmer ghugni until the consistency thickens.The peas must be softened well and there must not be any bite to them.Remove the red chillies when simmering further as they can soften too much and disintegrate into the curry.The consistency of ghugni is medium—not too runny or thick. It has enough gravy to coat the peas, giving it a smooth, slightly saucy texture that's perfect for serving with poori, paratha, or as a chaat with puffed rice and other toppings.Lastly add bhaja masala or garam masala powder.Add chopped coriander leaves. Mix well and set aside. Check the taste and add more salt if needed.Keep in mind that the consistency will thicken as ghughni cools. So you will need to add some water when you reheat it.Making Tamarind WaterRinse and then soak the dried tamarind in ½ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.Squeeze the softened tamarind and extract its pulp in the water itself.Strain this tamarind water and set aside.More PreparationAlso chop finely onions, green chillies and coriander leaves.

Remove in a plate and set aside.Frying nutsKeep all the ingredients ready before you begin. Heat desi ghee in a heavy kadai. Please do not use a non-stick kadai. A heavy iron kadai or aluminium kadai works best for frying gond.Let the ghee melt. Keep heat to medium-low.Add almonds. stirring often fry almonds till their color changes and then remove with a slotted spoon. Keep aside.Now add cashews. stirring often fry cashews till they become light golden or golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep aside.Add pistachios. Fry for some seconds till their colour changes. remove and keep aside.Frying gondNow in the same ghee, add one piece of gond. If the gond comes up gradually and puffs up, the oil is ready for the gond to be fried. If the gond settles down in the oil, then increase the flame and let oil become hot. If the gond comes up quickly, then oil is very hot. Reduce the flame to lower the oil temperature.Add gond in two batches. If you are an experienced cook, then add gond in a single batch. Stir non-stop and fry gond till all of them puff up.The gond pieces have to be fried evenly. So stir non-stop. Fry them well in ghee and do not burn them.Remove the puffed up gond in a slotted spoon. Keep the fried gond aside and let it cool.Roasting wheat flourReduce the heat to a low and then add 2 cups whole wheat flour in the same ghee.Mix flour very well with ghee. Begin to roast flour with the ghee.Meanwhile when atta is getting roasted, add fried nuts in a grinder jar or spice-grinder. Also add the fried gond in a dry grinder jar.Pulse and grind to a semi fine or coarse powder. You can keep the nuts whole if you prefer instead of powdering them.Do note that atta is getting roasted when you grind the fried gond. If you are not able to multitask then switch off heat after frying gond. Crush gond in grinder. Then switch on heat again and let ghee become slightly hot. Add atta and roast. You can also use a belan (rolling pin) and crush gond. Keep the powdered gond and nuts aside.Continue to keep on stirring and roasting the atta.Roast atta till its color changes and you get a nutty aroma.Then stir nonstop when you see the flour changing its color.Stir and roast till the atta becomes golden or brown. Overall it took me a total of 17 minutes for the atta to get roasted to perfection.Note that the timing will vary with the material, size and thickness of the kadai or pan. If you use steel kadai, then it will take less time.Making gond ke ladduSwitch off the heat. Keep the kadai down and raisins and cardamom powder.Next add the powdered sugar. add the crushed gond and nuts mixture.Begin to mix with a spoon. While mixing, break the sugar lumps if any in the ladoo mixture with a spatula or spoon. Mix very well.When the laddu mixture is still hot and the heat is tolerable to you, take a heaped size portion of it in a spoon or in your palms. Shape in a round ladoo. In case the heat is not tolerable, then do wait for some minutes. Avoid burning your hands. If the mixture does not hold shape, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons ghee. Note that the ghee should be in a semi-solid state at room temperature.Make medium sized ladoo from this whole mixture. Store them in an airtight steel container (steel dabba). They stay good for a couple of months. This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled. From this gond laddu recipe, you can make 17 to 18 laddu.Serve Gond ke Laddu just by itself or with some hot or warm milk. ",NutritionCalories: 235kcal | Carbohydrates: 30g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 7g | Cholesterol: 26mg | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 100mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 13g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 11mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 8µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 30mg | Phosphorus: 75mg | Zinc: 1mg

A bit of sweet and some sourness in any dish tastes too good and so does in this Gujarati dal. It is a veganrecipe made without onion and garlic.,20minutes,20minutes,40minutes,5.0,,Main Course,Gujarati,Vegan,For cooking lentils▢ ¾ cup arhar dal (tuvar dal or pigeon pea lentils)▢ 2 to 2.5 cups water or add as needed,"Pressure cooking lentilsFirst pick the arhar dal or pigeon pea lentils for stones etc. Then rinse the lentils thoroughly in running water for 4 to 5 times.Add the rinsed dal in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Add water. Pressure cook for 7 to 8 minutes on a medium to high heat.Read on below in the notes section on cooking lentils in the Instant pot or in a pan. The lentils have to be cooked completely and softened really well. Mash the dal very well with a wired whisk or with a spoon. The lentils should be mashed very well.Making gujarati dalAdd green chili-ginger paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander-cumin powder, jaggery, salt, tomato(optional) and kokums. Mix well.Add water to get a medium to medium-thin consistency. Mix again and keep the cooker back on the stove top.Bring the dal to a simmer on a low heat for 7 to 8 minutes stirring often. For temperingHeat oil or ghee in a small pan. Crackle mustard seeds first and then add cumin seeds.Add the dry red chilies, cloves, cinnamon, curry leaves, asafoetida and fenugreek seeds. Stir and fry for some seconds until the red chilies change color.Carefully, pour this tempering mixture together with the oil in the simmering dal. Switch off the heat. Add coriander leaves. Finally stir the dal.Serve piping hot gujarati dal with steamed rice.Serving SuggestionsGujarati dal is best served with hot steamed rice.

Have a complete meal by pairing the dal and rice with a side of any Indian vegetable dish or salad or raita or a plain yogurt.You can relish the dal with some soft roti or crispy paratha or even bread or dinner rolls (pav). StorageIt is best to eat Gujarati dal when freshly cooked. Lentils always taste best when served hot and as soon as they are cooked. If you have leftovers, then store in the refrigerator and try to consume the same day or at the most next day. Dal when refrigerated, will thicken with a change in flavor and taste.

Gujiya Recipe (Fried and Baked),https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gujiya-recipe-1-280x280.jpg,"Gujiya is a popular and traditional North Indian sweet of a crisp, flaky pastry filled with a sweet khoya (evaporated milk solids) and dry fruits stuffing. They can be fried as well as baked. Get both the fried and baked versions in this recipe.",45minutes,30minutes,1hour,12.0,gujiya,"Desserts, Sweets",North Indian,Vegetarian,For pastry dough▢ 1 cup whole wheat flour – 120 grams▢ 1 cup all-purpose flour – 125 grams▢ ¼ teaspoon salt▢ ⅓ to ½ cup water or add as required▢ 2 tablespoons Ghee,"Making the pastryTake the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour and salt in a bowl.Heat ghee in a small pan or bowl until it melts and becomes warm. Pour the ghee on the flours.First mix the ghee with a spoon. Then rub and mix the ghee with the flours, with your fingertips to form a bread crumb like texture.Add water in parts and begin to knead. The amount of water needed will depend on the quality and texture of the flour.Knead the dough till firm and tight. Cover the dough with a moist cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.Making sweet stuffingCrumble or grate the khoya (mawa).Chop the nuts, raisins and set aside.Melt ghee in a pan on a low heat.Add the crumbled or grated khoya.Stir the khoya continuously on a low heat.Cook the khoya, till it begins to gather around itself. Switch off the heat and place the pan on the kitchen countertop. Let the khoya stuffing cool completely at room temperature. Later add powdered sugar, the chopped nuts, raisins and cardamom powder. Better to sieve the powdered sugar if there are lumps.Mix everything well and keep the stuffing aside. Check the taste and add more sugar if you prefer.Assembling and shapingDivide the dough into two parts.Make a medium log of each part and slice it into equal parts.Roll each part in your palms to make balls and place all the balls in the same bowl. Cover with a moist kitchen towel.Dust the rolling board lightly with some flour. Roll each ball with the rolling pin to a small circle having 4 to 5 inches diameter. Don't add too much flour while rolling. If you can roll without the flour, then it is better.With your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply water all over the circumference edge.Place about 1 to 1.5 tablespoon of the prepared khoya filling on one side of the circle, keeping the edges empty. Don’t add too much of stuffing as it becomes difficult to shape gujiya and they may break in the oil.Carefully, bring together both the edges and join. Gently press the edges.With a small gujiya cutter or pizza cutter, trim the extra edges. When doing this method, it is very important that the gujiya is pressed and sealed well. Avoid this method if you plan to fry the gujiya. If baking then this method is good. As even if the filling comes out, you don't have to worry as there is no mess.However, it is best to make pleated design at the edges if you plan to fry the gujiya. This way the stuffing does not come out while frying and the gujiya look good too. Just keep on folding and twisting the edges till the end.Prepare gujiya this way and arrange them on a plate or tray. Cover the guijya with a moist napkin so that the dough does not dry out.Baking gujiyaPreheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius (390 degree fahrenheit). Brush oil or melted ghee n the gujiya evenly all over.Place them in a baking tray.Bake the mawa gujiya for 20 to 30 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (390 degree Fahrenheit), until they are golden. Oven temperatures vary, so do keep a check while baking. Place them on a wire rack for cooling. Once cooled, store them in an air-tight jar or box.Frying gujiyaHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.First test the temperature of oil, before frying. Add a small piece of the dough in the oil. If the dough comes up gradually and briskly, then the oil is ready. If the dough sits at the bottom, the oil is still cold. If the piece of dough comes up briskly and quickly, the oil is too hot.Gently slid the gujiya in oil. Just add a few pieces and don't overcrowd. At a time depending on the size of the pan/wok/kadai, you can fry 2 to 3 gujiya at a time on medium-heat. Turn them over carefully as fry the other side. Deep fry till they have become golden turning over as needed. Drain on kitchen paper tissues. Fry all gujiya this way and once they are cooled completely at room temperature, store them in an air-tight box.Serve gujiya to your family and guests when required.Serving suggestionsGujiya is eaten like any Indian sweet as it is. If you fancy something more indulgent, pair the mawa gujiya with some Rabri (thickened sweetened milk).StorageWhen the gujia cools at room temperature, immediately place them in an air-tight jar. They stay good for a few hours at room temperature. Since the stuffing is made with milk solids, I suggest to keep any leftovers in the refrigerator for about 1 to 2 days.",NutritionCalories: 221kcal | Carbohydrates: 24g | Protein: 6g | Fat: 12g | Saturated Fat: 5g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 10mg | Sodium: 95mg | Potassium: 76mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 81IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 2mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 123mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 25µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 23mg | Phosphorus: 63mg | Zinc: 1mg

Mash it very well. There should be no lumps. You can also grate and then mash the khoya.Then add grated paneer, rava (sooji), all purpose flour (maida), baking powder and cardamom powder to the mashed khoya.There should be no lumps in both the mawa and paneer. As if they are there, then you will find the texture of the gulab jamun not so good. The bits and pieces of mava or paneer will give a bite in the mouth, when you have the gulab jamun. They won't be smooth.Mix well. Add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Don’t knead.Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.Make small balls from the dough. Cover the balls and keep aside.Making sugar syrupDissolve sugar in water. Heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. You just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.Add rose water and stir. Keep the sugar solution aside.

Continue frying the rest of the dough balls in batches.When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and the gulab jamun, on a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes till the jamun become soft.Heating helps the gulab jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. The jamun increase a bit in size. Don’t overcook as then the jamun can break.Use a large pan, so that the jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature.

The recipe comes handy if you don’t have khoya or paneer/chenna readily available. All you need is milk powder, curd (yogurt), sugar and water to make a tasty homemade batch of this famous Indian sweet.",30minutes,20minutes,50minutes,14.0,Milk Powder Gulab Jamuns,Sweets,North Indian,Vegetarian,For the Jamun▢ 1  cup  milk powder▢ ¼  cup  all-purpose flour▢ 1  teaspoon  oil  OR ½ teaspoon ghee▢ 1 pinch salt  (optional)▢ 1 pinch baking soda▢ 1 to 2  tablespoons Curd (yogurt)▢ 1 tablespoon pistachios – blanched or almond slices; for garnish,"Making Sugar SyrupFirst mix the sugar, water, cardamom powder and saffron in a pan and keep it on the stovetop.Gently bring to a boil and continue to stir occasionally.Add some pistachios in the syrup. An optional step but tastes good. Make a thick sticky syrup and turn off the stovetop; much before the sugar solution reaches a one thread consistency.You can cook the sugar syrup till it reaches a half string consistency. On cooling, if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.Making Milk Powder Dough BallsMix the milk powder, all-purpose flour or maida, a pinch of baking soda, a pinch of salt (optional) in a mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon oil OR ½ teaspoon ghee and 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh curd or yogurt.Just mix everything lightly. Add some more curd if the mixture looks dry. Don’t over mix or knead. You don’t want gluten to form, so just mixing well is enough. The all-purpose flour is just added to bind the mixture. If gluten forms then the dough balls become dense and won’t absorb any of the sugar syrup and the jamun will not be soft.The mixture will be sticky but smooth. Apply some oil on your palms and make small balls from the dough. These dough balls almost double when frying and also increase when soaked in the sugar syrup. So don’t make large sized balls.There should be no cracks on the dough balls. They should be smooth. If there are cracks, then just add some 1 or 2 teaspoons of curd or milk to the mixture and continue making the balls.Once done, then cover the balls with a kitchen towel.Frying Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or a pan. When the oil becomes medium hot, lower the heat. Add a small ball in the oil. The ball should slowly rise to the top from the bottom. If it does not rise then, the oil is not hot enough. If it rises quickly and browns also quickly, then the oil is too hot to fry.If the small ball does not crack or break while frying, you are alright to proceed further. If it cracks, then just add some 1 or 2 teaspoons flour to the dough and form the balls again. In an ideal case, the dough ball should not crack and should rise slowly to the top and should not get browned quickly.When you know the oil is hot enough and on a low heat or medium-low heat, then add 3 to 4 balls or more depending on the capacity of your kadai or pan. When the sides touching the oil, become light golden or golden, turn over the dough balls with a slotted spoon and fry the remaining sides. The balls have to be stirred with a slotted spoon frequently to get even browning. But take care as hot oil is there in the pan. The balls should also not become browned too soon. They have to be cooked from the inside too.Keep on turning the balls until they become golden. If the oil becomes cold, then don’t fry the balls. Increase the temperature and then fry. Otherwise, the balls would have a hard crisp thick cover when fried in a less hot oil and they won’t absorb the sugar syrup. Plus they would absorb a lot of oil too.Soaking jamun in sugar syrupWhen the balls are evenly golden and browned, remove from the slotted spoon and add them directly into the sugar syrup.Keep the fried golden balls in the sugar syrup for at least 1 to 2 hours before serving. This is done so that the jamun soaks up the sugar syrup which will make them soft and sweet. That’s why in the sweet shops, the gulab jamun are always soaked in sugar syrup.If you feel the jamun is not soaking in the sugar syrup, then warm the gulab jamuns together with the sugar syrup on stove-top for a couple of minutes. Cover and set aside. Just warm the sugar syrup, don’t heat.Gulab jamun can be served warm or cold.

Place a strainer on the pan. Line the strainer with clean muslin or cheesecloth or cotton napkin. You can even line the pan directly with the muslin.Adding food acidWhen the milk starts boiling, add the lemon juice or vinegar. Begin to stir. The milk has to curdle completely.

In this case also add 1 to 2 teaspoons more of the food acid and stir again. You should see the greenish colored whey in the milk.After the milk has curdled completely and you see the greenish whey, switch off the heat and then immediately pour the entire mixture in the strainer lined with the muslin, cheesecloth or cotton napkin.Carefully gather the edges of the muslin as the coagulated milk mixture will be very hot.

Remove the rice flour in a mixing bowl or pan.Kneading DoughIn the same kadai or pan in which rice flour was roasted, add water and salt.Let the water come to a boil. The water has to be hot but should not be very hot. Do not allow it to come to a rolling boil. When you see tiny bubbles appearing in the water and it begins to start boiling, that is the time you switch off the heat.Add the hot water to the rice flour.Begin to mix thoroughly with a spoon or spatula.Keep on mixing and when the heat is tolerable then you can begin to knead. If you cannot knead then wait for 1 to 2 minutes and when the heat can be tolerated then start kneading. Do note that the dough has to be hot when you knead.Knead to a smooth and soft dough. If the dough looks dry then you can sprinkle some warm water on it and continue to knead. If the dough become sticky then add a few tablespoons rice flour and knead.Making IdiyappamTake the disc meant for making the idiyappam and spread some water or oil on it.Also before you start making idiyappam, heat 2 cups water in a pan or pressure cooker and let it come to a boil. Keep water on a medium-low to medium heat.Grease the idiyappam maker with some oil or water before you place the dough in it. Cover the rest of the dough with a kitchen napkin so that they don't dry out.Divide the dough into 2 to 3 portions. Prepare a log from one portion and place it in the idiyappam press/murukku maker.Now begin to press the idiyappam/murukku maker directly on the idli moulds in a concentric round circle.Form one roundel of the idiyappam. Note that while making idiyappams, the dough has to be hot or warm.Continue to make idiyappams on all the idli moulds.Sprinkle some grated coconut on top of each idiappam.Now place the idli stand in the pan.Cover pan with a lid. If using pressure cooker, then remove the whistle (vent weight) and cover and seal the cooker with its lid.On medium to high heat steam idiyappams for 9 to 10 minutes. After they are cooked well, turn off the heat and let the idiyappams be inside the steamer pan for 1 to 2 minutes.Then remove the idli stand from the pan. Remove the idiyappams with a spatula and serve the idiyappam. If you have used banana leaves then you just need to pick up the banana leaves and serve. If not serving immediately then place the idiyappam in a casserole so that they stay warm.Serve idiyappam or nool puttu with veg korma, potato korma, mushroom korma, veg stew or potato stew or jaggery sweetened coconut milk.",NutritionCalories: 55kcal | Carbohydrates: 11g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 0.1g | Sodium: 52mg | Potassium: 16mg | Fiber: 0.5g | Sugar: 0.1g | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.02mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.003mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 0.4mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin C: 0.1mg | Vitamin E: 0.02mg | Vitamin K: 0.003µg | Calcium: 4mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 0.1mg | Magnesium: 6mg | Phosphorus: 15mg | Zinc: 0.1mg

Also heat 2 to 2.5 cups water in a pot, idli steamer, 5 litre pressure cooker or an electric cooker.In a mixing bowl take the prepared idli mix flour and sour curd.Add water in parts. So you can add ⅓ to ½ cup water first.Then begin to mix with a wired whisk. A wired whisk works best as it helps to dissolve the lumps in the batter.Add more water and continue to mix.

You can briskly whisk this mixture for a minute to aerate it a bit.Remember to use a wired whisk to make a smooth lump free batter.You need to get a batter which is thick yet flowing, almost like an idli batter.Sprinkle the fruit salt or eno all over the batter evenly. As soon as you add eno, mix very well and be quick. Do mix the eno very well with the batter. Otherwise you will have a faint green color on the idlis as well as uneven texture in them.Pour the batter in the prepared idli moulds. Carefully place the idli stand in the pot or idli steamer or 5 litre pressure cooker or an electric cooker.When you place the idli stand in the pot or steamer, the water will be hot. So place it carefully.Cover with the lid of the pot or the Idli steamer. Steam the idlis for 10 to 12 minutes or till they are done and a tooth pick or fork inserted in the idlis, comes out clean. Note: If you have used a stovetop 5 litre pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid. Place the idli stand carefully in the cooker as the water will be hot. Then seal the lid (without the vent weight/whistle) tightly on to the cooker and steam the idlis on medium to medium-high heat for 10 to 12 minutes.These idlis cook faster. So do keep a check. Do not overcook as then they will become hard.Once done, remove them and allow to sit for a few minutes.Then with a butter knife gently remove the idlis from the mould. Place them in a casserole.

There is no sautéing of any ingredients. Simply add the ingredients in the Instant Pot and pressure cook. An easy and quick way to make this lentil preparation.,15minutes,45minutes,1hour,4.0,,Main Course,"North Indian, Punjabi","Gluten Free, Vegetarian","For soaking▢ 1 cup black gram (whole urad dal with their husks), 210 grams▢ ¼  cup kidney beans (rajma), 50 grams▢ water as required – for soaking","Soaking lentils and beansRinse the lentils for a couple of times before soaking. Soak both the kidney beans (rajma) and whole black lentils (urad dal) in enough water, overnight if you are making this in the morning. If you are making it in the evening, then soak the lentils in the morning.Later discard all the water from the lentils well and then rinse them with fresh water. Drain the water again.Add the rinsed lentils in the inner cooking pot of the IP. Making tomato pureeTake the chopped tomatoes, chopped ginger and chopped garlic in a blender or mixer jar. Alternatively, you can use 1 cup canned tomato purée and 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste and add directly in the pot. Blend till fine and smooth. Set aside.Cooking in the instant potAdd all the spices powders – turmeric powder, cumin powder, kashmiri chilli powder and Garam Masala or Punjabi Garam masala. Also, add salt as per taste.Now add the blended tomato, ginger, garlic puree and 3 cups water. You can even add finely chopped ⅓ to ½ cup onions at this step. Stir and mix very well.Turn on the Instant Pot. Press the pressure cooker button on high pressure and set the timer to 30 minutes. You can even use the Bean/Chili option of the Instant Pot which has an auto setting of pressure cooking on high pressure for 30 minutes.When the cooking time is completed and you hear the beep sound, wait for 10 or 12 minutes. Then do a quick pressure release (QPR) – carefully lift the pressure valve to remove the extra steam and pressure.Remove the lid. You will see that that the beans and lentils are cooked well, but the consistency of the curry is slightly watery and broth-like. Note that the final consistency should be smooth and creamy. Thus the whole mixture has to be simmered until the consistency thickens a bit and becomes creamy. Keep in mind that the lentils have to be softened and cooked well. You should be able to mash both the urad dal and rajma with a spoon if they are cooked completely. If the lentils are undercooked than pressure cook for some more minutes. Add some water if required. Simmering furtherOnce the lentils have softened and tender, they need to be simmered further. To do this, press the sauté button on Instant Pot and set the time to 7 or 8 minutes on normal setting.Add the butter. Stir and mix to combine.With the back of the spoon mash some of the lentils and beans. Stir often. The stirring will also help in mashing a few of the cooked lentils and beans. Mashing the lentils also helps in making the gravy smooth as well as slightly thickens the consistency.While using the sauté option, you can even set it to the low mode for a slow simmer. But keep on stirring often. Once the consistency is thickened, add cream and kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Mix well. Both these ingredients are optional and you can skip them. Remember the consistency should be neither thick nor thin. If it becomes too thick and then add some water. Also, keep in mind that the consistency will thicken more on cooling.While simmering do stir often so that the lentils do not stick to the bottom of the inner pot. Serve Instant Pot Dal Makhani with Indian Flatbreads like roti, naan bread, tandoori roti or lachha paratha or aloo paratha. You can also serve it with cumin rice or biryani rice. If you like then while serving drizzle some cream or top with some butter.

These spirals are made with a fermented batter of all-purpose flour, gram flour, baking soda, turmeric powder and are later deep fried. This homemade jalebi recipe makes for crispy, crunchy, syrupy, juicy jalebi and follows the traditional method or technique.",15hours,45minutes,15hours,20.0,Jalebi,Sweets,North Indian,Vegan,for making jalebi batter▢ 1 cup all purpose flour – 125 grams▢ 2 tablespoon gram flour (besan)▢ ⅛ teaspoon turmeric powder▢ 1 pinch baking soda or ¼ teaspoon baking powder▢ 1 cup water▢ 1 to 2 tablespoons all purpose flour to be added later after the batter has fermented,"Making batterIn a mixing bowl, take the 1 cup of all purpose flour or maida. Add besan or gram flour, a pinch of baking soda and turmeric powder.Mix all the above dry ingredients with a spoon or spatula.Then add water. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of flour used. I added 1 cup water. Depending on the quality of flour and besan, you can add from ¾ to 1 cup water.With the spatula or spoon, first mix. Break the small or tiny lumps with the spatula or spoon while mixing.Then in round circular directions stir the batter briskly for 4 minutes. This adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.The batter should have a flowing consistency. Cover and keep the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. I kept for 15 hours. If you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours and if you live in a hot or warm climate, keep for 6 to 10 hours. After fermentation the batter will have tiny air-pockets in it with a tangy taste. Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.With a spoon mix very well.Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.Preparing sugar syrupTake 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebi.Add ½ cup of water.Keep this pan on stove top on low heat and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the heat and add ¼ tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebi in it.Frying jalebiHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavor.To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebi to be fried. The frying temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit/176 degrees Celsius.Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.You won't get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.Some jalebi will be cooked faster than others.Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.Adding fried jalebi to sugar syrupThen immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes or more, they will have a deep color.Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature.

If you do not have saffron strands, then skip it or use an orange natural coloring extract.Mix saffron with the mixture.Keep on stirring and sautéing the halwa mixture on a low heat.Once the mixture starts thickening, you will feel a bit heavy while stirring the mixture. The lightness that was there before won’t be there.The halwa mixture has to be stirred often and sautéed on a low heat till it thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.Once the halwa mixture thickens and starts separating from the pan, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons ghee.Mix the ghee very well.After adding ghee continue to sauté on a low heat till the halwa starts separating from the pan. This will take 2 to 4 minutes.Then switch off the heat and add the green cardamom powder.Also add the cashews and raisins.Mix very well.Let the kashi halwa cool down a bit and then serve.

The bananas have to be completely unripe with a green skin.In a large bowl take 4 cups water and add 1 teaspoon turmeric powder.Mix very well with a spoon.Now peel the nendran plantains. Don't throw away the peels. With the peels you can make delicious banana peel thoran.Halve the peeled bananas and place them in the turmeric water for 30 to 40 minutes. They should be completely immersed in the water.Before frying, take ½ cup water in another bowl along with 1 tablespoon salt. Mix very well. Keep the salt solution aside.Now take two banana pieces and wipe them dry with a clean kitchen towel.They should be thoroughly dried before you slice them. Ensure there are no water droplets or any moisture on them.Making kerala banana chipsHeat 1.5 cups coconut oil in a kadai for deep frying. If you do not have coconut oil, then you can use sunflower oil or any oil for frying. Keep the heat to medium.For slicing bananas its better to use a mandoline slicer as the slices are thin. Thin slices make for crispy chips.Add a thin slice of one or two banana chips in the oil. If they come up steadily on top, the oil is ready. The oil has to be medium hot, so fry on medium heat. Do not fry on low heat as the banana chips will absorb too much oil.Using the mandoline slicer directly slice the banana over the oil. Be careful while doing so. Alternatively you can slice the banana chips in a tray or plate and add the slices in the oil.As soon as you add the slices stir them with a slotted spoon. Do not overcrowd the kadai with the banana slices while frying.Begin to fry on medium heat and in between you can turn over the banana chips.Keep on turning them and frying until they become lightly crisp.Then sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the salt solution on the oil. For a more salty taste you can sprinkle 2 teaspoons salt water. But be careful when doing this as the oil sizzles and splutters a lot.As soon as the oil bubbles and sizzles, quickly cover the kadai with a splatter screen or mesh screen (if you have one) or else skip. With the splatter screen the oil does not splutter outside.After adding the salt solution, continue to fry until the sizzling and bubbling sound stops.The banana chips will be completely crispy and when you move them towards the side of the pan, you will hear a crispy sound.With a large slotted spoon, remove the banana chips draining the extra oil in the kadai.Place the chips in a large mesh strainer which is placed below a pan or bowl. This helps in draining the extra oil if any.Alternatively you can also place the fried banana wafers on kitchen paper towels. This way fry the banana chips in batches. While frying the later batches, if the chips taste too salty, then you can opt to add ½ teaspoon of the salt solution to the hot oil.As soon as the banana wafers cool down at room temperature, place them in a jar.

Take besan or gram flour in a mixing bowl or pan.Add turmeric powder, asafoetida, lemon juice, ginger paste, green chilies paste, sugar, oil and salt.Add 1 cup water or as required to make thick yet flowing water. The amount of water required depends on the quality of flour, so add as required.Stir and then add the rava or sooji (semolina). Stir to a smooth thick batter without any lumps.The batter should be thick yet flowing. A quick tip is that if the batter become thin, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons besan. Bring to a boil 2 to 2.5 cups of water in a steamer pan or electric cooker or a stove-top pressure cooker. The amount of water to be added depends on the size of the steamer or pressure cooker.Now add the eno or fruit salt to the batter. Stir briskly and quickly. The fruit salt should be mixed evenly with the batter. Or else you get uneven texture in the khaman.The batter would froth and become bubbly, so you have to be quick.Pour the batter in the greased pan.Steaming khaman dhoklaPlace the pan in a steamer or electric rice cooker or pressure cooker. The water should already be boiling or hot when you place the pan with the batter. When using pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid and cover the cooker tightly with its lid.Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in an electric cooker. If using a pan or pressure cooker, steam for 12 to 15 minutes on a medium to high heat. To check the doneness, insert a toothpick and if it comes out clean, the khaman is done. If the toothpick has the batter on it, then you need to steam for some more time.When the khaman become lukewarm or cool, then with a butter knife gently slid along the edges. Keep a plate or tray on top of the pan.Invert the pan. If greased well, the khaman will easily get inverted on the plate. Slice and keep aside.TemperingIn a small pan, heat oil.Add mustard seeds and let them to crackle.When the mustard seeds are crackling, add the cumin seeds (optional), curry leaves and chopped green chilies (optional).Stir and then add sesame seeds.Fry the sesame seeds for some seconds but do not brown them.Then add water.

Make sure that the sugar has dissolved in the water. Then pour this tempering mixture evenly on the steamed and sliced khaman.Garnish with chopped coriander seeds and grated coconut.Serve khaman dhokla straight away or you can store them in an air tight box and then serve later after some minutes or an hour. If serving khaman after many hours, then do not garnish with coconut and coriander leaves. Serving SuggestionsThe sweet, savory, fluffy cakes pair great with any spicy or sweet Indian chutney.You can also serve it with your evening chai.Storing SuggestionsIf you plan to serve khaman after a few hours or next day, then I do not recommend to add coconut or coriander leaves. Simply pour the tempering. Refrigerate the khaman in a covered container. While serving you can warm with a sprinkling of water in a microwave or an oven.If using the instant pot to warm, then steam for 1 to 2 minutes. While serving add the coconut and coriander leaves.

You can also place the dough in a tray or a plate and then knead.Knead to a smooth and soft dough. Then cover the dough with a damp muslin or cotton cloth. Now allow the dough to rest for 10 to 12 minutes.Then make small balls from the dough. The rice dough balls should be smooth. Some may get cracks, so just rub a bit of water on your palm and shape them into balls again which will get rid of the cracks.Assembling and stuffing the sweet kozhukattaiMethod 1 – Making round kozhukattaiTake the dough ball and gently flatten it with your fingers.

Press to even it and seal the kozhukattai.Now gently open or unlock the mould. Carefully remove the kozhukattai from the mould.Alternatively you can also flatten the ball. Then place the coconut filling in the center. Make small pleats and bring all the edges together and then join. Prepare all the kozhukattai this way using the kozhukattai mould. Steaming kozhukattaiThen take pan and grease it with ghee or oil. You can even line the pan with banana leaves or turmeric leaves.If you have a large pan then place all the prepared dumplings on it without them touching each other. If using a medium-sized pan, place half of the dumplings in each of the two pans. Make sure there is some space between dumplings in the pan. Stack these two pans on top of each other. You can also steam in batches. Cover them with a moist muslin or cotton napkin before you begin to steam.In a large pot place a stand or rack. Add 2.5 cups of water.Let the water come to a boil.With the help of tongs, then keep the pans containing kozhukattai in the pan.Cover the pan with a lid.Steam for 10 to 15 minutes on a medium-low or medium heat.

Mix very well.Keep the bowl or pan covered for the flavors to blend for 4 to 5 minutes.Then serve the lemon rice.While serving you can choose to garnish chitranna with some chopped coriander leaves (cilantro).Serving suggestionsServe lemon rice with pappadums or with a side vegetable salad or even coconut chutney also goes great with this dish.It can also be packed in the tiffin box. As lemon rice can be served at room temperature, it also makes a great picnic lunch item. It’s a light dish and you can have it as a light lunch or breakfast too.StoringLeftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for a day. Leftover rice is not good for health, so I suggest to finish the lemon rice in a day.

Also add ghee or oil.Now add water in parts and knead to a smooth soft dough. I added ¾ cup water. Depending on the quality of flour, you can add ¾ to 1 cup water.Knead till smooth and soft. Cover the dough and keep aside to rest for 20 minutes.Making stuffing for littiIn a mortar-pestle take the cumin seeds and fennel seeds. Lightly crush them and keep aside.Take the sattu or roasted black chickpea flour in a mixing bowl or pan.Add the slightly crushed cumin seeds and fennel seeds.Next add carom seeds, nigella seeds, red chilli powder, chopped green chilies, finely chopped ginger and garlic, chopped coriander leaves and black salt. Also add regular salt as per taste.Add lemon juice and mustard oil.Mix very well.Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons water all over and mix the flour with water evenly. Do add more water if required. The sattu stuffing mixture should not be too dry or too wet. If the mixture is dry, then the dryness is felt when eating litti.Stuffing & shaping littiAfter 30 minutes, now make small or medium sized balls from the dough.Sprinkling some flour, roll each dough ball to a circle of about 5 to 6 inches.Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing in the center.Pleat and then join the edges. Press the joined part and lightly roll the stuffed dough balls in your palms, so as to get a round shape. Keep aside.Another method is to flatten the the dough ball with your palms and make a shallow cup.Now place the stuffing.Gently bring together the outer dough cover in the center, while pressing the stuffing. Join and then seal the edges. This is a bit tricky method. So please use the method which suits you.Keep the prepared littis under a cotton towel or napkin, so that the dough does not dry out.Prepare all stuffed littis this way and place them on a baking tray, which has been greased with some oil. Do grease baking tray well, otherwise the littis can stuck to the tray.Baking littiPlace the littis in a preheated oven at 200° C/390° F. Preheat the oven for 20 minutes at 200° C/390° F prior to baking.After 10 to 15 minutes of baking, remove the tray and flip each litti. Keep the tray back in the oven.Again after 10 to 15 minutes, remove the baking tray and flip each litti. Place the tray back in the oven. This has to be done once or twice more for even baking of littis.Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes or till the crust looks done with some light brown or golden brown spots on them. Timing will vary upon the size and litres of the oven. It took me about 40 minutes for these to bake.Brush the littis with some melted ghee all over.This particular step is optional and only to get charred spots on the litti. Secure the baked litti in a pair of tongs and place it on fire. Rotate for a few seconds till you see some charred spots on litti.Serve these Bihari style litti with baingan chokha, aloo chokha and tomato chokha accompanied with a small bowl of melted ghee. The litti is broken, dipped in ghee and then eaten with the chokha.Making baingan chokhaRinse the bainga/eggplant/aubergine in water a few times. Place it on a wired rack on a stovetop or you can place it directly on the stovetop flame.Keep turning the eggplant after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that it is evenly cooked.Roast the eggplant till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid easily in the eggplant. Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools.Then peel it and chop.Add the chopped baingan in a mixing bowl along with its juices.Then add the finely chopped onions, chopped green chilies, chopped garlic and chopped coriander leaves.Add mustard oil. If you want, you can add ¼ to ½ teaspoon lemon juice for a slight tang. Season with salt.Mix everything very well.Making tomato chokhaRinse tomatoes very well in water first. Then place them on a wired grill rack placed on the stovetop and begin to roast the tomatoes. You can also place them directly on the stovetop flame. You can also grill the tomatoes or roast in the oven. But then you won't get the smoky flavor.Turn them after a few minutes for even roasting. The tomatoes should get charred.Roast the tomatoes till they are completely cooked from within. With a knife check the doneness.

Soak the beans for 30 minutes in enough water. Later drain and rinse the beans again with water. Drain very well and set aside.If you are short of time, skip the soaking and move to the sautéing step. Keep in mind that you will need to cook the black eyed beans for some more time if they have not been soaked.Making lobia recipeIn a 3 litre pressure cooker or pressure pan, heat oil.Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.Then add the chopped onions.Stir and saute till the onions become translucent.

The lobia should be soft enough and when pressed with your fingers, it should get mashed easily. Check the beans once they are cooked through.Let the pressure fall naturally in the cooker and then only open the lid. Once the lobia beans are cooked, simmer the gravy without the lid so that it gets thickened.You can also mash a few cooked beans to thicken the  lobia masala gravy.The consistency of the lobia curry is neither thin nor thick.Lastly add chopped coriander leaves and give a final stir. You could also garnish lobia masala with chopped coriander leaves while serving.Serve lobia curry with roti, paratha, naan, puri, steamed rice or jeera rice.It is best to eat this black eyed beans curry as soon as it is made.

Set aside. This will be the sweet-tangy and crunchy stuffing for the kofta.Make medium sized balls from the kofta mixture. If it feels sticky, rub some oil on your palms before shaping the kofta.Flatten one kofta ball lightly with your palms on a chopping board or a rolling board. Place a small portion of the cashews and raisins stuffing on it. Gently bringing the edges together, shape into a neat ball. Rub some oil in your palms while shaping. Make sure that the stuffing remains in the center of the kofta.Fill and shape all the kofta in this manner.Cover with a lid and set aside at room temperature or refrigerate for 30 minutes.Making kofta gravyHeat oil in a thick bottomed or heavy pan or skillet.Add all the whole spices and fry for a few seconds or until the spices crackle and the oil becomes fragrant.First add the onion paste. Stirring often sauté the onion paste until it becomes golden. To quicken the cooking of onions, add a few pinches of salt when you begin to sauté the paste.When the onion paste has become golden, add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for about ten seconds or until the raw aroma of the ginger and garlic goes away.Add the tomato puree and sauté for 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium-low heat.Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, fennel powder, kashmiri red chili powder, garam masala powder.Mix well and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes stirring often.Add cashew paste. Mix well and sauté until the oil starts to leave the side of the masala paste. This sautéing takes about 9 to 10 minutes on low to medium-low heat. You will see that the paste becomes lumpy and gathers around itself. It will also become slightly glossy with some oil releasing at the sides. Then add sugar and salt as per taste.Add water. Mix thoroughly with a spoon or wired whisk. Simmer until the gravy begins to thicken. This takes about 8 to 10 minutes on a low to medium-low heat. The consistency of the gravy can be medium-thick to thick. When the gravy is cooked through, you will some oil specks on the top of the gravy. Lastly add the crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and cream.Mix well and set the gravy aside. Check the taste and add more salt or sugar if needed.Frying paneer koftaHeat oil in a frying pan or a wok (kadai). Before shaping and frying the entire batch, check a small tiny piece of the paneer kofta in hot oil. If it does not break, then you can easily fry the remaining koftas. If it does break, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of cornflour (cornstarch) as a binder. Mix the binder in well, then shape into koftas.The kofta should also come up swiftly yet gradually in the hot oil. This means the oil is hot enough for the kofta to be fried. If it browns too quickly, the oil is very hot and if the kofta remains at the bottom, the oil is warm. Carefully add the paneer kofta to the hot oil, being careful not to spatter the oil. The oil should be medium hot and have a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees Celsius (356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).When one side becomes golden, gently turn over with a slotted spoon and fry the second side. Fry turning over a couple of times until golden on both sides.Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate. Working in batches, fry all the paneer kofta this way and drain them on a paper napkin so that the extra oil is absorbed.Serving malai koftaIf serving immediately, add the fried paneer kofta to the gravy in the pan.Or if you want to serve it in a better way, take some of the gravy in a serving bowl. Place the kofta neatly on the gravy. Drizzle some cream or top with grated paneer. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves or mint leaves and serve. If serving a few hours later, reheat the gravy until hot. If it looks very thick, add a bit of hot water. Warm the kofta in an oven at 120 degrees Celsius or 250 degrees Fahrenheit for some minutes.

Mix the dry ingredients well.Add the khoya and curd (yogurt). Please use fresh yogurt. Instead of khoya you can also use milk powder.Add water and begin to stir to a thick or medium-thick flowing batter without lumps.Cover the bowl and allow the batter to rest for 30 minutes.Meanwhile when the batter is resting blanch the almonds and pistachios in hot water. Keep them soaked in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. Then peel and slice them. Keep aside.Making sugar syrupIn a pan take sugar and water. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. On a low heat simmer this mixture.You need to have a ½ string or 1 string consistency in the sugar syrup. If you cannot achieve these string consistencies than just make a sticky syrup.The sugar needs to be kept warm. For this keep the sugar syrup on a hot water bath so that it stays warm throughout and does not crystallize. Meaning you have to keep the sugar syrup pan on a bowl or another pan filled with hot water. The hot water should touch the base of the pan containing the sugar syrup.Making malpuaHeat ghee in a frying pan or skillet.When the ghee is heating up add baking soda to the batter.Stir to combine so that the baking soda is mixed evenly with the batter.Lower the heat. Take 2 to 3 tablespoons or a ladle of the batter and gently pour it on the hot ghee. Spread the batter lightly with the back of the spoon.

Prepare all malpua this way and coat them with the sugar syrup.Pour some rabri on top. Garnish with the chopped almonds and pistachios. Serve the malpua with rabdi hot. You can also just serve them coated with the sugar syrup and garnished with the blanched nuts.Making rabri to serve with malpuaIn a broad thick bottomed pan or sauce pan or a kadai take the whole milk and bring it first to boil.Lower the heat and continue to simmer the milk stirring at intervals.Bring the clotted cream/malai which forms on top of the milk to the sides of the pan. Also keep on scraping the dried milk from the sides and add them back to the milk.Do stir often so that the milk does not get burned at the bottom of the pan. Keep on simmering, stirring, removing the clotted cream and scraping the cream of the sides. Switch off the heat when the milk has reduced to ⅓ or ¼ of its original volume. The milk would also have thickened. It will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour for the milk to thicken on a low heat.Add sugar. Stir well so that the sugar dissolves.Next add crushed saffron or saffron powder along with kewra water (pandanus water) or rose water.

Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices. Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls.Make all veggie balls this way and set aside.Frying veggie ballsHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veg manchurian balls. If the ball breaks, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all-purpose flour.Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much of oil.When cooked from one side and light golden or golden, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.Fry the balls till crisp and golden turning over as needed for even cooking.

Add the chopped spring onions, finely chopped ginger, finely chopped garlic, finely chopped green chilies and finely chopped capsicum.Stir fry on medium flame till the onions turn translucent.Now add the mixed sauces. Stir and mix very well.Add 1 to 1.25 cups water. Let the mixture come to a boil.Mix the cornflour paste again in the bowl (as the cornflour settles at the bottom) and then add in the pan.As soon as you add cornflour paste, mix very well so that there are no lumps.Continue to stir and mix when the veg manchurian gravy is cooking. Simmer till the sauce thickens and you see a glaze in it.There should be no raw taste of the cornflour in the sauce. Cooking sauce or gravy takes about 3 to 4 minutes on a medium heat. If the sauce is too thick, then you add some water. If it is too thin, then you can add some cornflour.When the veg manchurian sauce thickens, add ½ teaspoon black pepper powder.Season with a bit of salt.

This step is optional but does help in getting rid of any moisture from the spices and salt.Later, take the fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds in a dry grinder jar or a spice-grinder and grind to a coarse mixture.Rinse and wipe the raw mangoes and let them dry naturally. You can even wipe them dry with a clean kitchen towel. Making Pickle Masala MixtureChop the mangoes into 1.5 inches pieces. and add them in a bowl. Discard the stones but do peel off the flesh from the stones, if any. No need to remove the outer skin of the mangoes if they are soft and tender. Take the chopped mangoes in a large non-reactive mixing bowl. Now begin by adding the ground fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds first.Then, add fennel seeds, nigella seeds or onion seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder and salt. With a steel or wooden spoon, mix very well so that the spices uniformly coat the mango pieces. Check the taste of the pickle masala mixture or 1 to 2 mango pieces. The taste should be slightly salty. If not, then add some more salt. Next pour ½ cup mustard oil and mix very well.Spoon the prepared pickle mixture in a clean ceramic jar or glass jar. Use a clean spoon.Making Mango PickleCover with a lid and keep in sunlight for 3 to 4 days.Note that the sunlight should be very good with the strong rays falling on the pickle jar. It should not be cloudy or dark.Everyday after sun-drying in the evening, open the lid and give a gentle mix to the pickle with a clean spoon. Take the mango pieces settled at the bottom upwards in the jar and give a thorough mix. Basically, mixing and tossing needs to be done everyday. In the evening, get the jar inside and keep in a cool dry place. Next morning, keep in the sunlight again.After keeping in sunlight for 3 to 4 days, add the remaining 2.5 cups mustard oil. Again with a clean spoon, mix very well. The oil should seep inside and reach the bottom of the jar. All the mango pieces should be surrounded with some oil.You can add more mustard oil if required.Note that you do not need to heat the mustard oil.Do keep in mind that the mustard oil should float above the pickle by 2 to 3 inches. Always remember to keep the oil floating above the pickle.Seal tightly with a lid, keep in a cool dry place for 4 days until everything gets mellowed and pickled.Initially, you may find a slight bitter taste in the pickle, but after 6 to 7 days, the bitterness will go away.Storage SuggestionsThis Mango Pickle stays good for more than a year at room temperature without refrigeration.Store the mango pickle in a clean, dry, sterilized glass or ceramic jar. Always ensure a layer of oil floats above the pickle to preserve it. Once opened, use a clean, dry spoon and seal tightly after each use.I recommend to take a small portion of the pickle for a week or 15 to 20 days in smaller jars or bowls.

If cooking in a pot, then you may need to add more water.When the pressure settles down naturally, spread the rice on a plate. Keep aside and allow the rice to cool at room temperature. When the rice is warm, cover and keep so that the rice grains do not dry out.While the rice is cooking, rinse, peel and chop the raw mango.Making mango paste In a grinder jar, add the chopped mangoes along with dried red chilies (broken and deseeded), chopped green chili, sesame seeds, peanuts, grated coconut and powdered or grated jaggery. I added jaggery to balance the sourness of the mangoes. If you don't have dried red chilies, add a total of 2 to 3 green chilies. I used Byadgi red chilies which are not very hot. If using a hotter variety of red chilies, reduce the amount to 1 or 2.Without adding any water, grind to a semi-fine paste. Don't make a fine paste. Keep aside.Making mango riceIn a pan, heat oil and add peanuts.On low heat, sauté the peanuts till they change color.Then, bring the peanuts to the side of the pan and add mustard seeds in the center. Let the mustard seeds crackle. You can also add 1 teaspoon each of chana dal and urad dal at this step. If adding chana dal or urad dal, allow them to turn golden before you proceed to the next step.When the mustard seeds crackle, add curry leaves and dried red chilies. Stir and sauté till the red chilies change color.Then, add asafoetida and turmeric powder. Mix well.Now, add the ground raw mango-coconut-spices paste. Stir and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes on low to medium-low heat or until the mixture thickens more and comes together. Next, season with salt.Stir and mix very well again. Remove pan from the stovetop and set aside on the kitchen countertop.Add the sautéed raw mango-coconut-spices masala to the cooked rice. You can mix in batches or at once. The rice has to be at room temperature before you start mixing.Now, with your hands, gently mix the rice with the raw mango-coconut-spices masala. I mixed both the cooked rice and the masala in batches in a bowl.Serve Mango Rice with some fried papads or chips. You can also serve with some yogurt or pickle. While serving, you can also garnish Mango Rice with chopped coriander leaves if you prefer.",NutritionCalories: 530kcal | Carbohydrates: 74g | Protein: 10g | Fat: 22g | Saturated Fat: 6g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 9g | Sodium: 634mg | Potassium: 332mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 12g | Vitamin A: 983IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 38mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 85mg | Vitamin E: 3mg | Vitamin K: 4µg | Calcium: 65mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 403µg | Iron: 2mg | Magnesium: 59mg | Phosphorus: 161mg | Zinc: 1mg

Take rice and flattened rice in separate bowls. Take the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds in one bowl.Rinse the urad dal, chana dal  and fenugreek seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.Rinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside.Rinse flattened rice once or twice and then add to the rice.Pour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours.Making batterBefore grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils and keep it for grinding urad dal. Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal. You can even use fresh water while grinding. Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula.Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. To make the batter, I added 1 cup water. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency. You can even grind to a smooth batter. Now pour the batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.Add ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt.Mix the salt very well with the batter. Also mix both the batters very well. Cover and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours. You can keep batter to ferment for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city.Preparation for potato fillingFirst rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker. You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender.When the potaoes are cooking, soak the chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain the chana dal and keep aside.When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the water from the potatoes and let them become warm. Then peel and chop them.Also slice the onions thinly and chop the green chilies, ginger and coriander leaves.Making potato fillingHeat oil or ghee in a frying pan or a skillet. Fry cashews and keep aside. This step of frying cashews is optional.Lower the flame and add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add the chana dal.Saute the chana dal for 2 to 3 minutes on a low flame or till they turn light golden or golden. Now add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger.Saute the onions stirring often till they soften and turn translucent.Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida (hing). Mix very well.Add water. Mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit.Next add the boiled chopped potatoes and mix very well. You can also mash the potatoes if you like while cooking them.Season with salt according to taste. Also add ¼ teaspoon sugar for a slight sweet taste.Simmer on a low flame for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally. The water will reduce and the consistency will thicken. Switch off the flame and then add chopped coriander leaves. Also add the fried cashews now and mix well. The potato filling should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato filling. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency.Stir and keep the potato filling aside.Making masala dosaLightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter and it would have increased in volume.Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don't smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won't be able to spread the batter.Keep the flame to a low, while spreading batter.Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan.On a medium flame, cook the dosa.Sprinkle some oil on top and edges. Cover with a lid and let it cook. You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon. Cook till its base becomes golden and crisp.When you see the base has become golden and the edges separate from the pan, place a portion of the potato filling on the dosa. You can spread it a bit if you want.Now fold the dosa and serve.Serving SuggestionsServe crisp restaurant style masala dosa hot with coconut chutney and sambar.Alternatively, simply make the dosa and serve the potato filling separately in a bowl.You can also choose to serve masala dosa with onion chutney, tomato chutney or peanut chutney.Storage and LeftoversThe batter stays good for 3 to 4 days in the fridge. You can opt to freeze the batter for a few weeks too. Store any leftover potato filling in the refrigerator for a day only.

Take the hot ghee or oil and all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, all the spices, dry fenugreek leaves, salt and baking soda in a mixing bowl.First mix everything well with a spoon. Then when the mixture is warm or cool enough to handle, mix the fat evenly in the flour with your fingertips.The whole mixture should resemble breadcrumbs. The more you do this, the more flaky texture the mathri or mathiya will have.Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water at a time and only mix the dough. Don't knead like a roti or poori dough. But only mix the water in the dough until it comes together. When the whole mixture can be easily clumped or gathered together into a ball, cover with a kitchen towel and keep aside to rest for 30 mins.Rolling mathariHeat oil for frying in a kadai (wok) or frying pan. Pinch small balls from the dough. Simply roll them lightly in your palms to even them. No need to give them a proper round shape.Keep the balls covered with a kitchen towel so that they do not dry out.Flatten each ball with a rolling pin to medium thickness. You will see jagged uneven edges and they are alright. Prick each rolled dough with a fork or pierce them with a knife.In case you want a smooth finish, then use a biscuit or cookie cutter. Roll a large piece of dough and cut with a cookie cutter.Frying MathriCheck the hotness of oil before frying the mathari.Drop a small piece and if comes to the surface gradually, then the oil is ready.If it comes to quickly, then the oil is very hot and the mathri will brown from out but remain uncooked from inside and will become soft.If it comes slowly, then the oil is cold. Result would be the mathari would absorb a lot of oil and become dense due to over frying.Fry them in medium hot oil turning over as needed until crisp and golden.Regulate the heat between medium-low to medium if required.Drain on kitchen paper towels and when cooled store them in an airtight box.Fry them in batches this way.

Add 3 cups water and pinch of salt to a pan. Add soya chunks. Boil for 5 minutes. This means that after the water starts to boil, continue to boil for a total of 5 minutes on medium heat. Drain the water. Rinse very well with fresh water. Press and squeeze the chunks to remove all the extra water the chunks have absorbed. Set aside. Sautéing Onions, Tomatoes, Herbs Heat 3 tablespoons neutral oil in a pan. Keep heat to medium-low or medium. Add 1 cup finely chopped onions and begin to sauté in the oil on medium-low to medium heat. Continue to sauté until onions start to caramelize and turn golden. Reduce heat to low. Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste to the pan with your caramelized onions.Mix and sauté for few seconds on a low heat until the raw aroma is gone.Add ½ cup finely chopped tomatoes. Sauté on low to medium-low heat until tomatoes soften and become pulpy. Let oil release from the sides.Add ground spices and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes on low heat. Assemble and Cook CurryAdd soya chunks with 2 tablespoons chopped coriander and 1 tablespoon chopped mint leaves.Mix well and season with salt.Add 1 cup water.Mix well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.TIP: If you do not have coconut milk, you can stop here and serve the soya chunks curry. The gravy here will have a medium to medium-thick consistency. If the gravy looks very thick, simply add a bit more water. Be careful not to add too much, as this will dilute the flavors. Optional – Add Coconut MilkIf including coconut milk, first switch off heat and then add 1 cup coconut milk. Mix very well. Put on the heat and simmer on low until the gravy is hot and then switch off heat. Do not boil as the heat can curdle the coconut milk.Optional – Temper Curry Leaves and ChilesIf you use coconut milk, I recommend following this step. Tempering the curry leaves and green chillies adds a lot of flavor to the curry gravy. If you are not using coconut milk, you can skip this step. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan. Whichever oil you have used earlier, use the same oil at this step.Add 1 or 2 sliced green chillies (depending on your heat preference) and fry them for a few seconds. Add 12 to 15 curry leaves (chopped or kept whole).Stirring well, fry for a few seconds until curry leaves are crisp. Add the tempered spices and oil to the prepared meal maker curry. Mix well.Serving SuggestionsServe meal maker curry hot or very warm with Roti or Paratha for dipping, or enjoy with simple Steamed Basmati Rice, Jeera Rice or Ghee Rice if you are gluten-free. Garnish the curry with coriander leaves or mint leaves. You can also serve this soya vadi curry as a side gravy with Vegetable Biryani or Pulao.Storage and LeftoversStore any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to one day only. Since coconut milk is used in the recipe, the gravy can curdle and go rancid if left for too long. To reheat, use a small saucepan. Add a bit of water if the curry has become thick.

Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight.Grind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water.If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it. Add all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix well.Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.With your thumb make a hole in the center.

Keep the heat to medium. Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil. Shape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don't overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. A very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then too the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil. Similarly fry remaining batches of medu vada with the batter.Any leftover batter can be refrigerated for about a day. Let the chilled batter come to room temperature before frying.Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. Medu vada can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.One of the best combination is sambar vada where these medu vadai are dunked in piping hot sambar and served with a side of coconut chutney.

Soak for about 2 to 3 minutes, later draining all the water. Soak the leaves in clean water for a couple of minutes. Swish and move the leaves gently with your fingers. This removes any soil or mud particles that are on the stems or leaves.Drain the water again. You can repeat this process of soaking and draining once or twice or choose to thoroughly rinse the leaves under running water for a few times. Finally, drain the water well. Place the leaves on a kitchen towel and spread them evenly on it for a few minutes or you can proceed to chopping them.Kneading DoughIn a bowl mix the whole wheat flour and salt. Add the chopped methi leaves, green chilies, garlic, oil and mix again. Pour water little by little and mix the dough first. Later knead to a smooth and soft dough adding water as needed.  Note that the water proportion will vary with the water content in the fenugreek leaves and the type, variety of wheat flour.Tip 1: If the dough looks sticky, add a few tablespoons of whole wheat flour and knead again.Tip 2: If the dough looks dry or dense, add a couple of tablespoons of water and continue to knead.Rolling doughPinch medium sized balls from the dough. Roll them between your palms to make a neat round ball. Flatten the dough ball and dust it lightly with some flour and the rolling board as well. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into medium sized roti or circle having 7 to 8 inches diameter. For a flaky, crispy layered paratha, spread ghee all over and fold twice into a triangle shape. Then roll them to a large triangle shaped dough sprinkling flour lightly.The layering method with ghee adds more fat in your parathas, but if you want a simple lighter version, then roll them plain with brushing any ghee on the dough as done in this recipe.RoastingHeat a skillet or tawa on medium-high to high heat. Place the rolled methi paratha on a hot tawa or griddle.Tip: To check the hotness of the skillet, sprinkle a pinch of flour on it. If the flour browns in a few seconds, the skillet is hot enough for roasting paratha.Wipe this roasted flour on the skillet with a kitchen napkin before placing the paratha on it.When one side is a bit cooked or about ¼ cooked, flip the paratha. You will see some air pockets beginning to form on paratha.Spread some oil or ghee (clarified butter) on the side that is facing you. Flip again and you should see some brown or golden spots on the paratha. Spread ghee on this side having the golden spots.Flip again a couple of times, until the paratha is evenly roasted and has some golden spots or blisters. Press the paratha edges with a spatula so that they get cooked.Roll the remaining dough balls and make the methi parathas this way. While making the second paratha don’t forget to wipe the skillet with a kitchen napkin if there is any excess whole wheat flour on it.Serving SuggestionsMethi paratha is best served hot. However, it can be served warm or at room temperature. You can also stack them in a roti basket or casserole box/container.Easily enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or at dinner. My favorite things to serve with methi ke parathe are vegetable curries, sweetened curd, or pickle.Some people like to have parathas with plain curd (yogurt), mango pickle, lemon pickle, or green chili pickle. It all depends on your preference!They can also be wrapped in foil and packed in lunch boxes or for short journeys.

Gently fluff the rice.Serve methi pulao hot with plain curd or raita. I served with aloo raita. Serving suggestionsWith raita: Serve methi rice with plain curd or raita. Methi pulao will pair nicely with most raita varieties like onion raita, cucumber raita, boondi raita or onion tomato raita. With Dal: Even with a simple dal fry or dal tadka, methi pulao tastes delicious.In a lunch box: Methi rice also stays good in the lunch box for some hours. When packing it in a lunch box, add a side of veggie salad or a mango or lemon pickle. You can also pack it for short travels.StoringI do not recommend to freeze or make a large batch for freezing.

This also depends on how much water content the methi leaves have.Keep this batter covered aside for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes check the batter.The batter should be of medium to medium-thick and smooth, flowing consistency.If the batter is still thick then you can add a few teaspoons of water.Frying methi na gotaHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep fryer.When the oil is medium hot.

Mixture Recipe | Madras Mixture,https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mixture-recipe-1-280x280.jpg,"One of the popular South Indian snacks made during Diwali is this Madras Mixture Recipe which is basically a mix of various edible ingredients, nuts and dry fruits. It is also called as Omapodi Mixture.",15minutes,1hour,1hour,350.0,grams,Snacks,"South Indian, Tamil Nadu",Vegetarian,"For omapodi▢ 1  teaspoon  carom seeds (ajwain, omam)▢ 1  cup gram flour (besan) – 120 grams▢ ½  cup  Rice Flour or 100 grams▢ 1  generous pinch asafoetida (hing)▢ 2  pinches turmeric powder – optional▢ ¼  teaspoon  Red Chilli Powder▢ 1  teaspoon  salt  or add as required▢ 1  tablespoon  oil  or ghee or butter▢ 6 to 7  tablespoons  water  or add as required▢ oil  as required for deep frying","Making omapodiPreparing omapodi doughHeat a small pan and keep flame to a low. Add 1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds).Stirring often roast ajwain for some seconds till they are aromatic. No need to brown them. Let them cool down.Then add them in a small dry grinder jar or a spice grinder.Grind to a fine powder. Keep aside. You can even crush ajwain in a mortar-pestle. In this case, when adding ajwain, use a tea strainer and sift the ajwain powder through it. This is done so that when pressing through the sev maker, the dough strands do not break.In a mixing bowl or pan take 1 cup besan (gram flour) and ½ cup rice flour.Add the ground ajwain powder.Then add 1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing), 2 pinches turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder and 1 teaspoon salt. You can add salt as per taste. Turmeric powder can be skipped. For a spicy omapodi, you can increase the amount of red chilli powder. For more crispiness you can add a pinch of baking soda also.Mix very well with a spoon or spatula.Now heat 1 tablespoon oil in a steel bowl or a steel measuring cup.When the oil becomes hot, add it to the flour mixture. Instead of oil you can also use ghee or butter.Now add water in parts. First add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water. Mix well and begin to knead to a smooth dough. Overall I used 7 tablespoons of water. You can add 6 to 7 tablespoons of water depending on the quality of besan and rice flour.Knead to a smooth dough. If the dough becomes sticky, then you can add some more besan. If the dough looks dry, then add some more water and knead again. Cover the bowl and set aside.Use the disc to make sev or omapodi and assemble the sev press or murukku press. You can even use the disc with fine holes. Also heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying omapodi.Apply some water or oil in the sev/murukku maker. Then take a portion of the omapodi dough and place it inside the sev maker. Cover with the top part and keep aside.Frying omapodiLet the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small tiny piece of the omapodi dough. If the small piece of dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough for frying.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the sev maker on top of the oil and let the sev directly fall in the oil. While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a chakli. Do not over crowd the kadai with omapodi. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai. Be careful when pressing the dough in the oil. After the omapodi is pressed in the oil, break the top strands with a spoon or knife and let the dough strands fall in the oil.After adding the omapodi, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first for a minute. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.Gently begin to turn with a slotted spoon.Now fry the second side. You can turn over a couple of times for even frying.When the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry for some more seconds till the omapodi are golden and crisp. Turn over as needed when frying. Do not break the omapodi while frying as then it becomes extra work to remove the small pieces of omapodi from the oil. So fry the entire round shaped omapodi as one piece and do not break it.Once done then remove omapodi with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon draining off the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining omapodi in the same way.When the omapodi are cooled, then place them in an air tight container or box. Break omapodi before adding in the mixture. Making BoondiPreparing boondi batterTake ½ cup besan (gram flour) and 1 tablespoon rice flour in a mixing bowl.Then add 1 pinch asafoetida (hing), 1 pinch of baking soda, 2 pinches turmeric powder and ½ teaspoon salt.Mix everything with a spoon.Now add 8 to 9 tablespoons water in parts.Using a wired whisk make a smooth and slightly thin batter without lumps.The batter consistency is slightly thin. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of gram flour. So add accordingly.frying boondiHeat oil for frying in a kadai or pan. When the oil becomes hot, then tap the wired whisk or the handle of a spoon which has a bit of batter in to the hot oil.Now take a dry perforated ladle/jhara and place it above the hot oil. Don't keep too much on a height, as the batter droplets, when falling from a height, do not give a round shape. With a spoon add some batter on the perforated spoon ladle/jhara. Spread the batter lightly with a spoon. Finish up the batter on the perforated spoon ladle this way.On a medium flame heat to fry the boondi. Do not turn them. Let them become slightly crisp and then turn them.When the boondi have become crisp, turn them with a slotted spoon.After the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry the boondi for some more seconds so that they become crisp.Remove with a strainer spoon or a slotted spoon draining the extra oil.Place the fried salted boondi on kitchen paper towels.After each batch, wipe the perforated ladle/jhara with a clean piece of moist thin cotton kitchen towel from both sides. Continue to fry boondi this way. Once the boondi cools at room temparature, store in an air tight jar or box.When the boondi are frying you can remove the other ingredients and keep everything ready for the next step.Frying nutsUse a fine sieve ladle with a handle to fry as shown in the stepwise photos in the post.

Keep the sugar solution aside.)Making boondiMake a smooth flowing batter of the gram flour/besan, crushed saffron and water. The batter should neither be thick nor thin. It should be a flowing batter without any lumps. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of the the gram flour. So you can add more or less than what is mentioned in the recipe.Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil has to be moderately hot. Take a perforated ladle/spoon. With your hands position the ladle above the oil. You will need one more large ladle/jhara to remove the fried boondis.Take a large spoon of the besan batter and pour it on perforated ladle/spoon. Press with the other spoon so that the batter falls down from the perforations into the hot oil.Fry the boondi (gram flour balls) till they become golden. Don’t over fry or make them crisp. When the oil stops sizzling, remove the boondis. About 45 seconds to 1 minute is enough to get the correct texture in the boondi.This step is important because if boondi becomes crisp then motichur laddu won't be soft and they won't be able to absorb the sugar syrup.Making motichoor ladooFor collecting the fried boondi use a large slotted spoon/jhara. Drain the oil very well after removing the boondi and then add them directly to the sugar syrup. Also note that the sugar syrup should be hot.If the sugar syrup is not hot, then just heat it. In case, the sugar syrup crystallizes, then reheat again mixing 1 to 2 tablespoons water. No need to bother about the tailed or flat boondis as we will be pulsing them in the blender later.Make all the boondis like this and keep on adding them immediately to the sugar syrup. Stir and mix well. The boondis should get softened in the sugar syrup.In a blender or mixer add the boondi and the sugar syrup. Add 1 tablespoon of hot water and pulse the boondi mixture for a few times to get a smaller shape.Don't pulse too much otherwise you won't be able to shape the motichur laddu. The amount of water to be added depends on the texture of the boondis.If the boondis are a bit crisp, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons more of the hot water. The boondis absorb the hot water and remain soft and moist.Add the magaz/melon seeds and black cardamom seeds. Mix well.Apply some oil or ghee on your palms and shape the motichoor ladoo. The mixture would be warm when preparing the laddu. On cooling they become firm.You can garnish the motichoor ladoo with melon seeds/magaz or raisins. These motichur ladoo can also be refrigerated since they are not made from ghee.

For long tender sprouts, keep for 2 to 3 days.Do not touch the sprouting beans with your hands or with any spoon or fork to avoid contamination.Method twoThe second method is to sprout the mung beans using a muslin, kitchen cotton towel or cloth.Wet a muslin, cheese cloth, clean cotton cloth or kitchen cotton napkin with clean filtered water, and squeeze the excess water from it. Open the cloth fully. After rinsing and draining the soaked beans thoroughly, place them in the center on this damp cloth. Tie the ends and tighten into a bundle, and place in a clean bowl.Keep loosely covered in a container for 1 or 2 days. Be sure the lid on the container is not too loose and not tight.To check on the sprouting beans, do not open the cloth bundle.After the first day, examine the outside of the kitchen towel. You will see tiny little sprouts or longer sprouts growing out of the cloth fabric, especially if you have used a thin material like muslin or a cheesecloth. For more longer sprouts, you can keep it for one more day. StorageOnce completely sprouted the beans stay fresh in the fridge for 1 or 2 more days.Remove the sprouted beans from the bowl or from the muslin with a clean spoon and place in an air-tight steel container. Store in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.How to useYou could use the moong beans to make your favorite recipe. You could even have these raw in salads or slightly steam and have it plain or just with about anything, even toasted bread.Before using the sprouts, always rinse them in clean water or hot water. Add the sprouts raw in salads, or slightly steam and enjoy them plain or just with about anythingIf you plan to eat the sprouts raw, rinse them in hot water before including them in any raw recipe or dish.I make some recipes with the sprouts like this Mixed Sprouts Curry (where I include only mung sprouts) or this delicious Moong Sprouts Chaat and a healthy Moong Sprouts Salad.",NutritionCalories: 31kcal | Carbohydrates: 6g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 18mg | Potassium: 155mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 22IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 14mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 34µg | Calcium: 21mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 63µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 24mg | Phosphorus: 56mg | Zinc: 1mg

Keep the heat to its lowest and add urad dal.Begin to roast urad dal and keep stirring often when roasting the lentils.Roast urad dal till they become aromatic or are light golden. Do not make them brown. Remove in a plate and let the roasted urad dal cool at room temperature.Take the roasted urad dal in a small dry grinder jar or a small chutney grinder jar. Grind to a fine flour. Keep aside.Meanwhile, spread oil on the murukku disc. Also spread some oil on the part of the murukku maker where the dough will be placed.Making murukku doughIn a fine sieve, take rice flour. Also add the urad dal flour to the same sieve.Next add red chilli powder, asafoetida powder and salt. Sift the dry ingredients twice.To the sifted flours add sesame seeds, carom seeds and ghee.Mix everything very well. Then with your fingertips mix the ghee in the flour evenly. The mixture should resemble breadcrumbs.Hold a small portion of the murukku mixture in your palms and it should hold itself together. It should not break or fall apart. If it breaks or falls apart, then add 1 to 2 teaspoons more of the ghee. Mix again very well and then check.Now add water in parts and begin to mix and knead.Keep on adding water in parts and knead very well.You will need about 10 to 11 tablespoons of water. The amount of water needed will depend on the quality of rice flour. Check the taste of dough and add more salt if required.Knead to a smooth and soft dough. Also keep the dough slightly moist, but do not make too moist or wet as then the murukku absorbs more oil.Murukku has to be made as soon as you knead the dough, so keep everything ready before you shape and fry them.Shaping murukkuNow divide the dough in two parts and add first part in murukku maker. Cover the second part of dough with a kitchen towel.Before you begin to shape the murukku, keep oil in a kadai (wok) or frying pan to get heated. Keep the oil on a low or medium-low heat, so that it does not become very hot. Use any neutral flavored oil with a high smoke point.Use butter paper or parchment paper squares. Cut them in squares and keep ready before you make murukku. Press the murukku maker and move in rounds to get the concentric circles or spiral shape on the paper squares. Break the dough towards the end and press it to the last concentric circle of the spiral.Tip 1 – If the murukku breaks while forming them, this means that the dough does not have enough moisture. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water and knead the dough again.Tip 2 – If you are not getting proper shape, this mean that the dough is too moist. Add some rice flour and knead again.Make a batch of murukku. E.g make 3 to 5 murukku that you will be frying at a time.Frying murukkuNext test the hotness of the oil. Add a small piece of the murukku dough in the oil and it should come up gradually. If it comes up fast, the oil is hot, so reduce the heat. If it sticks or is at the bottom or comes up slowly, the oil is not hot enough, so increase the heat.Take the butter paper with the murukku in your hands. Then take a small to medium sized wooden spatula and place it on the murukku gently.Then gently turn over the spatula. The butter paper will be facing you. Lift the butter paper gently.The murukku will be neatly placed on the wooden spatula.Now gently tilt or place the spatula in oil, so that the murukku slides in the oil.Add the remaining murukku also in this manner. Fry on a medium heat.When they turn light golden, then flip them gently. Fry the second side. Fry the murukku till the oil stops sizzling or till they become crisp and golden. Do not brown them too much. Turn over as needed for even frying.Tip 3 – Check the first batch of murukku. If it looks like that the murukku has absorbed oil or breaks in oil, then add some rice flour, about 1 to 2 tablespoons and knead again. This happens if too much fat has gone in the dough.Remove with a slotted spoon draining extra oil in the kadai or pan itself.Place them on kitchen paper towels to soak extra oil.Once they cool at room temperature, then store murukku in an air-tight box at room temperature.Serve Murukku as a tea-time snack.",NutritionCalories: 49kcal | Carbohydrates: 5g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 3g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 2mg | Sodium: 37mg | Potassium: 5mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 2mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 2mg | Phosphorus: 5mg | Zinc: 1mg

This helps in reducing the lumps if any while mixing gram flour in the sugar syrup.Grease a pan or tray with some ghee. Use a pan or tray which can give you some depth and height, so that you can get rectangular or square pieces.Making sugar syrupNow take the sugar in a heavy thick bottomed kadai. Since a lot of stirring happens, I would suggest you to use a heavy and large aluminium or iron kadai. Please do not use non stick pan as due to the heat and lot of stirring, the non stick coating can get affected.Add ½ cup water in the sugar.Keep the pan on the stove top. On a medium-low or medium flame, heat the sugar syrup.Stir so that the sugar dissolves.Melting GheeMeanwhile also take the ghee in another pan and keep it on stove top. Let the ghee melt on a low flame or sim.The ghee has to be hot when we add it in the gram flour mixture. So let it be on a slow simmer.Adding Gram Flour to Sugar SyrupLet the sugar syrup start bubbling and boiling. We are not looking for one string consistency in the sugar syrup. Just let the sugar solution come to a boil and then add the gram flour.Add the gram flour in three to four portions. First add some of the gram flour.With a wired whisk, stir the gram flour briskly, so that it dissolves with the sugar solution.With one hand using a spoon, add the gram flour and with the other hand mix it with a wired whisk.Finish of all the gram flour this way.Stir very well, so that the gram flour has got mixed evenly with the sugar syrup. Adding GheeThen add ghee in parts. First add a ladle full of the hot ghee.You will see a lot of bubbles and frothing in the gram flour mixture after you add ghee.As soon as you add ghee, mix it with the gram flour with a spoon or spatula. Using a ladle, with one hand, add ghee and with the other hand mix it with a spatula.Then add the second portion of ghee and again mix it very well. Keep the heat to a medium-low or medium.This way finish off adding all the ghee in parts. Mix thoroughly.Do use a bigger kadai and also some gloves on your hands, as there is a lot of sizzling, frothing and bubbling that happens.Cooking Mysore Pak MixtureAll the ghee will be absorbed first and what you will see is a smooth molten gram flour mixture.On a medium-low to medium heat with non-stop stirring cook the gram flour mixture.You have to continue to cook and stir till you start seeing many bubbles in the mixture and the ghee is released from it. So continue to cook and stir. The mixture will also start to leave the sides of the kadai or pan. While stirring also scrape the bottom of the kadai and the sides. If you do not scrape, then the mixture starts sticking and gets browned or burnt.So you have to stir nonstop and scrape. Do use a flat steel spatula (palta) as this helps in scraping the gram flour mixture.When the mixture comes together in one mass and you see some ghee at the sides, then also continue to stir and scrape.When you see many small bubbles and holes in the mixture, then switch off the heat.If you cook too much, then you will get a very hard mysore pak.Setting Mysore PakImmediately and quickly tilt the kadai and pour the whole mixture in the pan. It falls in one lot and you don’t need to use any spoon for it.Level with a spatula or the back of small glass or a small steel bowl.Let the mysore pak mixture become warm or cool down. If there is too much ghee at the sides or top, then invert the pan after 20 to 30 minutes, so that the excess ghee is removed. You can use this ghee while preparing dosa or greasing idli plates.Once warm or cooled, then just invert the pan on a chopping board or tray or plate. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan. The mysore pak block falls of easily. Then cut the mysore pak into rectangular or square pieces.Store in an air-tight container. It stays good for about a week to ten days at room temperature.Serve as a festive sweet to your family or friends.",NutritionCalories: 217kcal | Carbohydrates: 23g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 13g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 33mg | Sodium: 7mg | Potassium: 78mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 19g | Vitamin A: 4IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.04mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.01mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 0.2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.04mg | Vitamin E: 0.1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 6mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 37µg | Iron: 0.5mg | Magnesium: 15mg | Phosphorus: 27mg | Zinc: 0.2mg

Take this flour in a mixing bowl.Then add rice flour and rava (finer variety of sooji.cream of wheat/semolina). Add fresh curd. You can also use sour curd. If using sour curd, then add ¼ cup and add more water to get the right consistency. You can also add ¼ cup fresh curd for a less sour taste.Add 1 cup water.

If using thick curd then you may need to add some more water.The consistency should be thin, watery and flowing like rava dosa batter.Making oats dosaOn a medium flame heat a cast iron pan or a non-stick pan. Drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon of oil and spread it with the spoon. Before adding the oil, if using a cast iron pan, sprinkle some water to check the temperature of the pan. If the water droplets sizzle and evaporate, the pan is ready to make dosas.Avoid sprinkling water on a nonstick pan as adding water on a hot nonstick pan, may affect the nonstick layer coating.Stir the batter in the bowl and take a ladle full of batter and pour it from the circumference to the center. Do not spread the batter with the back of the ladle like the way we do for regular dosas. Fill the small or large gaps with a bit more of the batter.Sprinkle some oil around the sides and in the small holes or gaps and cook the dosa.Once the base becomes crisp and golden, flip and cook the other side.Once this side is cooked and crisp, flip again and you can cook the first side to make it more crisp. Fold on the tava and remove.Transfer to a plate and preferably serve oats dosa hot. if you are not able to serve hot, then just cover the prepared oats dosa with a lid and proceed to cook the remaining oats dosa in a similar way.The crisp texture changes if you serve the oats dosa warm or at room temperature.

If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough for frying omapodi.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the sev maker on top of the oil and let the dough strands directly fall in the oil. While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a chakli. Do not over crowd the kadai with the dough strands. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai. Be careful when pressing the sev in the oil.After the dough strands are pressed in the oil, break the top sev strands with a spoon or knife and let the dough strands fall in the oil.After adding the dough strands in the oil, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first for a minute. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.Gently begin to turn with a slotted spoon. Now fry the second side.You can turn over a couple of times for even frying.When the oil stops sizzling, continue to fry for some more seconds till the omapodi are golden and crisp. Turn over as needed when frying.Once done then remove with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon draining off the extra oil.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining omapodi in the same way in batches.When they are cooled, then place them in an air tight container or box.Serve omapodi as a diwali snack or a tea time snack.",NutritionCalories: 352kcal | Carbohydrates: 41g | Protein: 9g | Fat: 17g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 800mg | Potassium: 296mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 50IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin E: 6mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 1mg | Iron: 9mg | Magnesium: 9mg | Phosphorus: 26mg | Zinc: 1mg

Rinse the parboiled rice or idli rice for a couple of times.Add 2 cups water. Mix well and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.Strain the urad dal and reserve the soaked water. Keep this water for grinding the urad dal.Add the strained urad dal in the grinder or a sturdy blender.Add the reserved water in parts and grind to a smooth and fluffy batter. Pour the urad dal batter in a large bowl or pan. To the same grinder or blender, add the half of the rice.Then add ¼ to ½ cup water and grind till smooth. A fine grainy consistency of rice is also fine in the batter. You can grind the rice in two to three batches. Overall add ¾ cup water for grinding rice. Pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.Add 1 teaspoon edible rock salt or as per taste. Mix both the batters very well with your hands or a spoon or spatula.Cover and allow the batter to ferment overnight for 8 to 9 hours. The timing will vary depending on the temperature conditions in your city.The batter should increase in volume and double or triple. Just lightly stir the batter. Check the consistency. If the batter looks too thick, you can add about ⅛ to ¼ cup water or more if required. Mix well.Making onion uthappamHeat up a well seasoned tawa or a cast iron pan, brush or spread some oil on the tawa. For a non stick pan, you need not grease the pan. The tawa has to be hot. While making uttapams, you can regulate the heat from low to high. Before pouring the batter, reduce the heat to low.Pour the batter with a ladle or spoon.Gently spread the batter to a thick pancake.First methodAdd some chopped onions. Lightly press the onions on the uttapam so that they stick to the batter.Drizzle with some oil on the sides and on the uttapam. Cook on a medium heat.When the base becomes golden and crisp, gently flip the uttapam.Cook the second side with the onions until the onions are golden or caramelized. You can keep the onions to a light golden, but ensure that the batter is cooked well.Optionally, gently press with the spatula so that the any uncooked batter also gets cooked well. If the uttapam is not cooked well, there will be raw uncooked batter in the center. So do make sure to cook it properly.Flip over to check if this side is cooked well. The onions will also be caramelized. You can caramelize the onions more if you like.Second methodIn a plate take the 1 cup chopped onions, 2 or 3 chopped green chilies, 12 to 15 curry leaves (chopped) and ⅓ cup chopped coriander leaves.Mix very well and set aside.Spread the batter on the tawa and top the onion mixture on the uttapam.Drizzle some oil on the sides and top.

Keep the heat to a low or medium-heat. When the ghee melts, add basmati rice.Stir the rice grains and sauté for about 30 seconds on a low to medium heat or till you get a nice fragrant aroma from the rice. Do not allow the rice to get browned.Then add milk which has been boiled before. The pre-boiled milk can be hot, warm or refrigerated. Stir the rice grains with the milk.Bring the milk to a boil first on a low to medium heat. Do stir when the milk is getting heated up, so that the bottom of the milk does not get scorched.After the milk has come to a boil, continue to simmer till the rice grains are cooked completely and softened.For quick cooking of the rice, I kept a lid on the pan. But in this case, you have to be in the kitchen so that you open the lid when the milk starts frothing up. Or else you can cook the rice uncovered. But do stir regularly.Another tip is cover the pan in such a way, so that some of the steam can be passed through.Continue to cook further till the rice grains are completely softened. After the rice grains are cooked, you can even mash them while stirring with a spoon or spatula.Once the rice grains are cooked well, add sugar. Stir so that the sugar is dissolved.Simmer for a further 8 to 10 minutes till the milk has reduced and the payasam has thickened. Do keep in mind that as this payasam cools it will thicken more, so you can decide the consistency which you prefer.Serve Paal Payasam as is or garnished with saffron, rose petals or sliced almonds. You can serve the payasam hot or cold. You can also offer the payasam to any deity first before serving to anyone else.Keep any leftover payasam in the fridge after it comes at room temperature.

Check the taste and add more salt if required. Now add paneer, which has been chopped in cubes.Gently mix and let the marination coat the paneer cubes evenly. Cover and keep aside for 30 minutes. If keeping for more than 30 minutes, then refrigerate.Making green chutneyTake all the ingredients for the green chutney in a grinder jar. Add 1 teaspoon water (optional) and grind coarsely. Since the coriander and mint leaves are rinsed, the moisture from them helps in grinding.Then add 2 tablespoon hung yogurt or thick curd.Grind to a smooth chutney. Remove in a bowl and keep aside. You can even refrigerate the chutney.Making veggie saladThinly slice onion, grate carrots and shred the cabbage or thinly slice them. Also thinly slice capsicum (bell pepper).Take all the veggies in a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon chaat masala, 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Also add salt as per taste.Mix very well and keep aside.Kneading doughIn a mixing bowl or pan or a large tray, take whole wheat flour, ½ tablespoon oil and salt.Then add ½ cup water in parts. First you can add ¼ cup water and add the remaining required amount of water later.Begin to knead. Add water as required and knead to a smooth soft dough.Cover the dough and keep aside for it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.Making rotiAfter 20 to 30 minutes, divide the dough into small or medium sized balls. This depends on the size of the wraps you want to make. You can also make mini wraps.Dust the dough ball with some flour. Then gently roll to thin roti. The roti should not be thick. If required while rolling, you can add some more flour.Place the roti on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook the base till you see blisters appearing on the roti or the roti is ¼ᵗʰ  cooked. Do note that the tawa or skillet should be hot. So cook on a medium-high to high flame. On a low flame, the roti will become very crispy or hard.Then flip roti. spread some oil all over.Then flip again when the second side is ½ cooked.Spread some oil on this side too. You will see golden blisters on the roti.Flip once or twice more for even roasting. Remove and keep the roti in a roti basket or in a warm casserole. Prepare all rotis this way.Making paneer tikkaHeat 2 tablespoons oil in a pan. Keep the flame to low or medium-low and add the marinated paneer cubes. Add the entire marination. Since I had used hung yogurt, I added the entire marinated mixture as the hung yogurt marination had coated the paneer pieces very well. But if you have used yogurt which has a thin consistency, then just add the paneer cubes.After a minute turn over the paneer cubes.Pan fry the paneer cubes turning often till the marination is cooked and the paneer becomes soft.Keep on stirring and turning them at intervals. Also use a well seasoned pan or a non stick pan, so that the paneer cubes do not stick to the pan while frying.I cooked the paneer for about 4 minutes on a medium-low heat. Do not cook too much as then paneer will become dense, cook on medium-low flame. Timing will vary with the thickness of the pan, intensity of the flame etc.Once the paneer is done, remove the pan from the flame and keep aside.Assembling & making paneer kathi rollTake one roti.Spread the mint-coriander-curd chutney over it.Now place the paneer tikka cubes in the center.Top with the veg salad.Roll both the sides of the roti and make a wrap.Wrap half portion of the rolls in butter paper or aluminium foil. If packing paneer roll for tiffin, then wrap the entire roll in aluminium foil and skip adding the green chutney and veggie salad.Serve paneer kathi roll with the remaining chutney or tomato ketchup.

Stir or whisk to make a smooth thick batter without any lumps.Cover and keep the bowl for 30 to 40 minutes till you see a bubbly and frothy layer on the top. The batter would also have risen.Add oil, salt and 1 cup flour. Mix with a spoon or spatula.Next add 1.25 cup flour. Mix again and then begin to knead for about 10 to 12 minutes.If the dough appears sticky then you can about ¼ cup flour more or as needed. The proportion of water to be added, depends on the quality of the flour. I added 3.25 cups flour for 1 cup of lukewarm water.Knead very well to a smooth, soft, supple and elastic dough. Place dough in a bowl. Spread oil or softened butter all over the dough. Leavening pav doughCover the bowl with a lid or a kitchen cotton napkin and keep the bread to leaven for 20 to 25 minutes.Once the pav dough has risen and doubled, then gently punch and deflate the dough and form a neat log.Cut the log into equal sizes.

The small buns would increase in size.Baking ladi pavJust before 15 minutes you bake the pav, preheat the oven at 200° C/ 390° F.For a regular oven, heat both the top and bottom elements. For a microwave oven with convection mode, preheat for 15 minutes at 180° C/356° F.Then brush the pav buns with some milk. This gives a golden color to laadi pav.Place the baking tray in the center rack in a preheated oven at 200° C/ 390° F for 25 to 30 mins or till the tops turn golden and the pavs sound hollow on tapping.

These are also known as Murmura Laddu and Puri Unde.",5minutes,15minutes,20minutes,16.0,Murmura Ladoo,Desserts,Indian,Vegan,"▢ 3 cups puffed rice (pori, murmura) or 60 grams (I have used puffed rice murmura here and not puffed flattened rice)▢ ½ cup jaggery powder or grated jaggery – 120 grams jaggery powder▢ ¼ cup roasted gram (bhuna hua chana) or 25 grams roasted gram▢ ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder or 2 to 3 green cardamoms, crushed in mortar-pestle▢ 4 tablespoons water","PreparationFirst grate/powder the jaggery, powder the green cardamoms and keep them ready.Keep your pans ready. This will make the process super simple.I used one pot to melt the jaggery, strained the cleaned jaggery into another pot.You will need two separate pans – one to dry roast the murmura/puffed rice, another to heat the cleaned jaggery and making ladoos. Instead you can use the same pan to roast and later to heat jaggery. Keep a small bowl of water ready. This is for checking the thickness of the syrup.Making murmura laddu mixtureNow, on medium heat dry roast the murmura/ pori or puffed rice for 1 to 2 minutes, so that it crisps up. Keep this aside or transfer to another bowl.To a separate pot, add ½ cup of the grated/powdered jaggery and 4 tablespoons of water.Heat this until with constant stirring all the jaggery melts and gets mixed with the water. Turn off the heat.Now, pass the melted jaggery through a sieve to remove impurities. Collect the clean melted jaggery in another pot/container.Now, pour this clean jaggery mixture into a pan and heat on a low flame. Keep stirring the mixture.Add cardamom powder and continue to stir.After a couple of minutes, if you hold up the ladle with drops of the syrup falling back into the pan, the last drop should form a sort of string as it falls. Keep checking the thickness as the syrup heats.To ascertain the thickness of the syrup, add a couple of drops into a bowl of water. The droplets should not dissolve into the water.You should be able to pick up the drop which will form a soft to firm ball. This is the right consistency.Now, pour this prepared syrup into the murmura/puffed rice. Instead you can reduce the heat of the heated syrup pan and add murmura/puffed rice into the prepared syrup. If doing for the first time, I would suggest, pour the puffed rice into the jaggery syrup, mix, then make laddus.Add roasted gram, mix everything very well using a spatula.Making pori urundaiThe ladoo have to be prepared when the pori urundai mixture is still hot, otherwise the mixture will harden and making ladoo will be difficult.Wet your palms slightly with water, pick up a portion of the prepared mixture and form ladoo by pressing gently between your palms and giving it a spherical shape.Prepare ladoo with the rest of the mixture in the same manner.If towards the end the mixture becomes too hard, put the pan back on gentle heat for a few seconds. This will loosen the mixture allowing ladoo formation.Serve Pori Urundai as offering to the deities or serve as a sweet snack.",NutritionCalories: 46kcal | Carbohydrates: 10g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 0.1g | Saturated Fat: 0.003g | Sodium: 0.3mg | Potassium: 3mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 6g | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.05mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 0.002mg | Vitamin C: 0.01mg | Calcium: 7mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 0.5µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 1mg | Phosphorus: 3mg | Zinc: 0.03mg

With your fingers, mix the oil evenly with the sooji.Now add all purpose flour to this mixture.Mix again very well so that the all purpose flour is mixed evenly.Add 3 tablespoons water first. Mix again. Then add 1 tablespoon water more and begin to knead the dough. Sooji absorbs water while kneading. Add water in parts while kneading.Then add 2 tablespoons more of the water and continue to knead. The kneading is very important in getting the perfect texture. The dough is not soft nor too hard.If you make the dough soft, then add 1 to 3 teaspoon more of the suji. If the dough looks hard, then add sprinkle some water and continue to knead.The suji puri dough should be elastic. Gluten strands need to be formed, which gives a structure and shape to the pooris. The correct texture of the dough, also help in puffing puris and helps in them staying crisp. Knead very well. Elasticity helps in rolling the dough without cracks and thinly. When rolling, the dough should roll easily without any cracks. You should be easily able to lift the rolled dough without it tearing or breaking and falling apart.Knead to a semi soft elastic dough and keep it in a bowl or pan.Cover the dough with a moist kitchen towel or napkin and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes. You can also keep the dough for an hour.After 30 minutes, knead the dough again.Assembling and RollingNow divide the dough into two or three parts. Take one part on your work surface and begin to roll. Avoid adding any dry flour while kneading. Keep the remaining dough covered with the moist kitchen towel.Roll to a large round. There should be no cracks in the rolled dough. You can flip the entire rolled dough without it breaking or tearing apart.Keep on rolling to a thin and even round. The puri have to be thinly rolled. If not thin, the base becomes thick and remains soft even after frying. If the dough is not rolled evenly, then the puri won't puff up.Making Suji Ke GolgappeWith a cookie cutter or a small bowl, cut small to medium discs from the rolled dough. Using a cookie cutter gives even shape and size to the pooris. You can also make small balls and roll them. But then the puri won't have an even and uniform shape.Remove the dough edges and place the small roundels in a plate without them touching each other. Keep these puris covered with a moist kitchen towel.Collect the egdes and knead them lightly. Roll the edges too and make puris the same way.In this way make all the puris and keep them covered in a moist kitchen towel. You can also roll them and fry simultaneously like I have done.Frying Suji PuriHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil should be medium hot. Add a tiny piece of the dough ball in the hot oil. If the ball steadily comes up to the surface, the oil is hot and the pooris can be fried now.Slid a few pooris in the oil. They will puff up quickly as soon as you add them to the hot oil. You can fry up to 4 to 8 pieces at a time, depending on the size of your pan.With a slotted spoon flip them, once they puff up. Even after oil stops sizzling, continue to fry till light golden. Frying this way, gives a crisp texture to the pooris from outside as well as inside. Otherwise, they remain soft from inside and crisp from outside.Fry them till they are a light golden or golden.Drain fried puri on kitchen paper towels. There will be a few flat puris too. These you can use to make sev puri or papdi chaat. Continue to fry all the pooris this way.Drain them on paper towels.Once they get cooled at room temperature, immediately add puris to a jar or box and close the lid tightly.Make pani puri, dahi puri or ragda puri or puchka from these homemade pooris or golgappas.

Drain the water. Then remove the peels from the nuts.Slice or sliver or chop them and set aside.Cooking milk to half of its volumeTake whole milk in a thick bottomed kadai or pan and begun to heat the milk on a low to medium heat, till the milk starts to froth or form a layer of clotted cream (malai) on top. Stir a couple of time when the milk is getting heated.So when you will see the cream floating on top, then with a spatula, gently move the cream layer.Bring it towards the side of the pan and stick it to the pan. Keep the heat to a low and continue to simmer. Keep on simmering the milk like this and collecting the cream layer on the sides.This process of collecting the cream layer has to be done many times. continuous simmering of the milk will bring the cream on top and you have to bring and stick it to the sides of the pan.In between also stir the milk gently on occasions, so that the milk does not get burnt from the bottom. If you do too much of stirring and if quickly, then you won't get the layers of cream in the rabri. So after you have moved the layer of cream (malai) to the side of the pan, then stir the milk a few times. Then wait until another layer of cream forms on the surface of the milk. You can also just thicken and scrape the milk solids from the sides but in this case you won't get the layers of clotted cream or malai in the rabdi. Making rabdi recipeOnce the milk reduces to half, then add sugar. You can add sugar as per your taste preferences.Then add crushed saffron strands and cardamom powder. Stir gently.Continue collecting the cream and bringing it to the sides of the pan. Also do stir the milk gently after you bring the cream towards the sides of the pan. If you don't stir the milk then there is a possibility of the milk getting browned or burnt from the bottom.After adding saffron, the color will change gradually to a beautiful yellow color as the milk keeps on reducing.When the milk gets reduced to ⅓ or ¼ of its original quantity, then switch off the heat. It took me about 1 hour 15 minutes on a low heat initially and medium heat towards the latter stage. I cooked it until ⅓ of its original volume. The cream layer will be collected on the sides with a spatula. Scrape off the entire cream layer as well as dried milk solids and add into the thickened milk.Stir gently. Then add the sliced almonds, pistachios and 1 teaspoon rose water or kewra water. Stir gently again. Reserve a few of the blanched and slivered nuts for garnishServing and Storage SuggestionsGarnish with some of the blanched almond and pistachio slivers. Serve rabdi hot or warm.If you are not serving hot or warm, let rabri cool at room temperature first. Transfer the cooled rabdi in an air-tight steel container and refrigerate it for a few hours.Keep in mind that it will thicken more as it cools at room temperature and even in the refrigerator. So keep the consistency slightly thin if you want to refrigerate it and serve cold or chilled.Whether you serve hot or warm or cold, if you prefer, garnish rabdi with some of the blanched, slivered nuts and sprinkle a bit of crushed saffron from top.Rabdi keeps well in the refrigerator for about 3 to 4 days.

For pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the cooker and secure the lid tightly on the cooker.Steam ragi idli for 12 to 15 minutes. Depending on the equipment you have used, it may takes less or more time. A tooth pick inserted in the center of the ragi idlis should come out clean and not be sticky. Allow a standing time of 1 to 2 minutes. You can steam the ragi idli in batches. The leftover batter can be refrigerated and you can make dosa or uttapam.Dip a spoon or butter knife in water and slid them through the idlis. Remove and place the ragi idli in a warm container like a casserole.Serve ragi idli with coconut chutney and veg sambar. For kids you can also serve with a mix of thin coconut milk and jaggery.

You can use a spatula with a wooden handle/base or the bottom of a wooden spatula. I used a wooden spatula.Measure 1 cup of ragi flour. Remove 2 teaspoons of the ragi flour and set aside.Add to 2 cups water in a sauce pan or pot. Add the 2 teaspoons ragi flour to the water and mix well.Add salt and mix again. Note that traditionally salt and ghee are not added, but I like to add some salt. Boil Ragi SlurryPlace the thick bottomed pan containing the slurry on the stove over medium heat.Stir occasionally. Let this slurry come to a boil. Make Ragi DoughWhen the slurry begins to boil, lower the heat and sprinkle the remaining ragi flour evenly all over the pan. Ensure that the ragi flour is evenly distributed across the top of the liquid. Do not mix or stir. Let it cook undisturbed for 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat.After this undisturbed cooking period, mix very thoroughly with the wooden stick.Ensure that there are no dry flour specks or lumps visible. Incorporate any visible dry flour into the the wet mixture by continuing to stir. The mixture will thicken and become sticky. NOTE: 2 cups of water works perfect for me. But if the dough mixture looks dry, add in a few tablespoons of hot water. If it is too moist, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of ragi flour. Keep on mixing for a few minutes and you will see the mixture clumping together and gathering around itself.Steam DoughScrape any remaining dough off the wooden stick and return to the pan. Cover and steam for 6 to 7 minutes on low heat.When the steaming is complete, turn off the stove and remove the pan from heat.  Allow it to remain covered and continue to steam for 5 minutes.When you take a tiny portion of the dough and shape into a ball, it should easily form a ball without sticking to your fingers.Knead and Shape Ragi MuddeBrush or spread some water on a plate. Transfer the cooked ragi mudde mixture onto the plate using the stick. Remove the small lump at the bottom of the pan. Leave the mixture that is stuck to the bottom or the sides; they cannot be removed without some soaking time. Spread water in your palms and begin to knead the mixture.This mixture will be very hot, so it the water in your palms and fingers will help you be able to knead.Knead very well to a smooth dough. If you like, add 1 teaspoon ghee.Portion the dough and make medium-sized balls from it. Shape into neat balls by rolling the dough between your palms.Place them in a steel box. I keep in the roti box, so that they stay warm and soft.Serve with saaru, basaru, Rasam, Sambar, red chili chutney*, Onion Chutney, Coconut Chutney or Tomato Chutney. *I have shared the recipe of red chili chutney below.Making Chili ChutneyTake 1.25 cups water, red chillies (broken and seeds removed) and tamarind in a frying pan.Cook for about 5 to 6 minutes on medium-low to medium heat until the red chillies soften.Drain the water and set aside the softened tamarind and red chillies. When warm, add them to a spice grinder or blender. Add salt as needed and 2 to 3 tablespoon water. Blend to a smooth chutney. Transfer to a heat proof bowl.Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan. Crackle ½ mustard seeds. Add 6 to 7 curry leaves, 1 pinch asafoetida and 5 to 6 methi seeds. When curry leaves become crisp, pour the tempering ingredients in the chutney. Mix and serve. Note that with kashmiri red chillies, the chutney is not very spicy. For spicy chutney use chillies which have a higher pungency. ",NutritionCalories: 155kcal | Carbohydrates: 34g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 126mg | Potassium: 193mg | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Calcium: 166mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 9µg | Iron: 2mg | Magnesium: 66mg | Phosphorus: 134mg | Zinc: 1mg

Use the proportion of 1:2 of rice and water depending on the quantity of rice you are using. Also, use a wide deep pan so that the water does spill out while cooking. Note that the amount of water to be added depends on the quality and quantity of rice. Sometimes some strains of basmati rice get cooked quickly in less water. In this case, you can add 1½ to 1¾ cups of water for 1 cup of rice.Add ¼ teaspoon salt or as per your taste. You can also add ½ teaspoon oil or butter or ghee. Adding any fat like oil or butter is optional. Let the water come to a boil on a medium to medium-high heat.Then add the rice and gently stir with a fork. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Do check once or twice when the rice is cooking.In case the rice grains look undercooked and the water has dried up, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons hot water. Stir gently with a fork then lower the flame and cook the rice till all the water has been absorbed and the rice grains have cooked well.Usually, rice takes about 7 to 8 minutes for the rice grains to be tender, soft and fluffy. However keep in mind that the cooking time will vary with the type or variety of rice grains, quality of the pan and the intensity of the heat.After the rice is cooked give a resting time of 5 minutes before you open the lid. Then open the lid and gently fluff the rice with a fork. For a detailed step by step method of making basmati rice you can check this post – How to cook basmati rice in a pot or pan.While serving, spoon the rice in a serving plate. Pour the rajma gravy on top of the rice. Serve with a side of some chopped lemons, sliced onions and/or chopped tomatoes.

This traditional sweet is made with whole milk that is split or curdled to make Chenna, which is then shaped into balls and cooked in sugar syrup. This Bengali rasgulla recipe will guide you in making the perfect soft and spongy rasgulla.",30minutes,10minutes,40minutes,18.0,Rasgulla,Desserts,"Bengali, Indian","Gluten Free, Vegetarian",▢ 1 litre whole milk▢ 2 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice or add as required▢ 2 cups sugar or raw sugar▢ 1 litre water▢ 1 tablespoon milk – optional▢ 1 teaspoon sooji (rava or cream of wheat) or all purpose flour or cornstarch▢ 1 to 2 tablespoon rose water or kewra water or ½ teaspoon cardamom powder,"Making chennaTake whole milk in a pan and keep it to boil on a low to medium heat. So when the milk is heating up, line a strainer or bowl with a cheese cloth or muslin.Keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the froth is not formed on top and the base does not get browned or the milk solids get stuck to the bottom.When the milk comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to its lowest. Add 1 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice. First add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and stir. If the milk has not curdled completely, then add 1 tablespoon more. Keep the lemon juice handy with you.Depending on the quality of milk, you may need to add 1 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Stir after adding the lemon juice. Sometimes I have added 1 tablespoon lemon juice and the milk has curdled and sometimes I needed to add 3 tablespoons too. Vinegar also can be added instead of lemon juice. Another option is curd/yogurt. Add 4 to 5 tablespoons of yogurt or more if required. With yogurt you don't need to rinse the chenna in water later.As soon as the milk curdles, switch off the heat. The milk should curdle completely with the green watery whey. If the milk does not curdle, then add ½ to 1 tablespoon of lemon juice more.Now pour the curdled milk in the cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer or bowl.Gather the muslin from the sides and rinse the chenna or coagulated milk very well in running water. This brings down the temperature of chenna as well as removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the chenna.Now squeeze the muslin with your hands very well, so that excess water is drained from the chenna. Remember there should not be excess water or moisture in the chenna as then the rasgulla will break when cooking.Place a heavy weight on the chenna for 7 to 8 minutes. You can also hang the chenna for about 30 minutes.Making chenna ballsAfter 7 to 8 minutes, remove the cheesecloth from the chenna. Note that the chenna should not have too much moisture nor be too dry.Add 1 teaspoon sooji or rava or semolina. You can also add all purpose flour (maida). Adding either of them helps to bind the mixture. First mix the sooji with chenna and then begin to knead.With the heels of your palms mash the chenna and knead. Keep on collecting the chenna from the sides and continue to mash and knead. This kneading process is very important and also decides the texture of chenna. When you feel your palms becoming a bit greasy, its time to stop. Just a bit of greasiness is required.Avoid kneading to an extent where the whole chenna becomes greasy. I kneaded for about 10 minutes as I have very light hands. So depending on the quality of chenna and the pressure you apply while kneading, you can take more or less time. Note that the chenna should just begin to get greasy.Knead to a smooth ball of chenna.Now pinch small portions from the chenna and roll them between your palms to a smooth round ball.Prepare all small balls this way. Cover all the chenna balls with a moist muslin or kitchen towel and keep aside.Making sugar syrupIn a large pan, take 2 cups sugar and 4 cups water.You have to use a large pot or pan so that there is enough space for the rasgulla to cook and increase in size. You can also use a stovetop pressure cooker. I used a pot measuring 8.5 inches in diameter and 4.5 in height – a 3.4 litre stainless steel pot.Keep this pan on stovetop and heat the sugar solution. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. I kneaded the chenna and cooked the sugar syrup simultaneously. You can also do this way.Add 1 tablespoon milk and stir. Adding milk helps in removing impurities. If there are no impurities then you don't need to add milk and directly proceed to step 6.Once the sugar solution becomes hot, the impurities begin to float on the top.You can either remove it with a spoon. Or strain the impurities in a cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer.Now from the purified sugar solution, reserve ½ cup in a cup or mug. This ½ cup of sugar solution we will be adding to the cooking rasgulla.Reserve another 1 cup of the sugar solution in a serving bowl.Making rasgullaThe rest of the 2.5 cups of sugar solution you add it back to the same large pot and bring it to a boil on a medium high heat.Slid the rasgulla gently into the sugar solution.Once all the rasgulla have been added to the sugar solution, shake the pot. Don't stir the rasgulla with a spoon. Just gently shake the pot.Cover immediately with a lid and let them cook. Keep the heat to a medium or medium high.After 4 minutes, open the lid and add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Shake the pan. Adding this reserved sugar solution ensures that the temperature and consistency of the sugar solution is maintained and the sugar does not cook to its thread consistencies.Cover again and continue to cook.After 4 minutes, again add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Cover and again cook for 2 minutes. I cooked for 10 minutes. The timing will vary depending on the thickness & quality of pan, the depth of the pan and heat intensity.To check the donenessThere are two ways. First place the rasgulla in a bowl or cup of water. If the rasgulla sinks to the bottom its cooked. Second method is to press a small portion of the rasgulla with your finger. If the pressed portion bounces back to its original shape, its cookedOnce they are cooked, switch off the heat and keep the pan down on the countertop.Soaking in sugar syrupNow take each rasgulla with a spoon and place it in the bowl containing the 1 cup of sugar solution. Cover and keep aside.Let the sugar solution in which the rasgulla were cooked, become warm. Then add this to the serving bowl containing the rasgulla.Once the whole mixture has cooled down, add 1 to 2 tablelsoons rose water. If you don't have rose water you can also kewra water (pandanus extract) or ½ tsp cardamom powder. Stir gently and allow them to be soaked in the sugar syrup for 30 minutes.Serving & Storage SuggestionsYou can serve the rasgulla now or refrigerate them and serve later cold or chilled.When serving place the required amount of rasgulla in each serving bowl. Pour a few tablespoons of the sugar syrup in each serving bowl. If you prefer garnish rasgulla with some slivered almonds or pistachios. Keep them covered with the sugar syrup in an air-tight container. They keeps well for about a week in the refrigerator. Do not store them at room temperature.",NutritionCalories: 91kcal | Carbohydrates: 23g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 10mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 22g | Vitamin A: 2IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin B12: 1µg | Vitamin C: 1mg | Vitamin D: 1µg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 6mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 1µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 1mg | Phosphorus: 2mg | Zinc: 1mg

You can choose to add ½ to 1 teaspoon red chili powder and ½ teaspoon cumin powder instead of dry red chili and cumin seeds.Grind to a fine powder and set aside.Take a plate, pan or a large mixing bowl. Place a sieve on top of it. Add gram flour and rice flour.Then add the ground roasted chana dal, salt and asafoetida. Sift the whole mixture.Next add white sesame seeds to the mixture and set aside. In a small pan or a bowl heat 2 tablespoons butter or oil. I have used salted butter, but you can even use unsalted butter.Heat till all the butter melts. Now add the hot melted butter in the flour mixture.With a spoon or spatula mix the butter with the flour. Mix very well. Check the taste and if required you can add some more salt.Now add ⅓ cup water in parts and begin to knead the flour mixture. Knead to a smooth and non-sticky dough. Cover and set aside. If the dough looks dry then you can add some more water. If it becomes sticky then add some more gram flour. Frying ribbon pakodaUse the nozzle shown in the below picture for preparing ribbon pakoda. This one has serrated edges. You can even use the plain one without the serrated edges. Also heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying ribbon pakoda. Apply some water or oil in the chakli/murukku maker. Then take a portion of the dough and place it inside the murukku maker. Cover and seal with the top part and keep aside.Let the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough. If the dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough.When the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the murukku maker on top of the oil and let the ribbon murukku directly fall in the oil.While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards on top of the kadai or pan. Do not over crowd the kadai with ribbon pakoda. Add as needed without overcrowding the kadai.After adding the murukku, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first.

Sift the flour with salt if you have flour which has a lot of bran. Add a bit of water, oil or ghee and start mixing.Adding water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough.Continue to knead the dough. Keep on adding water as required.Knead the dough till it becomes pliable, smooth and soft. The final dough consistency should not be very sticky or loose or hard.Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands to smoothen it.Flatten the ball. Sprinkle some whole wheat flour to the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour.Making PhulkaTurn on the gas stove and put the tawa to make it hot.While tawa is getting hot, start rolling the dough ball into a flat round circle.Once the tawa is sufficiently hot then put the roti on a hot tawa/griddle.First cook one side. It should be less than half cooked or about one-fourth cooked.Turn and cook the other side. This should be a little bit more cooked than the first side. Brown spots should be visible.Now hold the roti with a tong and keep the first side which was cooked, directly on fire. The roti will start to puff.Turn and keep the other side on fire. The roti will puff more. Avoid burning the rotis and also don’t overdo it as roti will not be soft and will become crisp and hard like papadums.Remove and apply ghee or oil on the phulka. Applying ghee or oil keep them soft for a long time. Phulka made with this method is ideally served hot.If you cannot serve them hot, then you can keep them in a container that keeps food warm like a casserole or in a roti basket. You can also wrap them up in a kitchen towel or napkin.Making Roti on TawaPlace the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Keep the heat to medium-high or high. Within some seconds you will see air pockets forming on the raw chapati doughRoast for about 30 seconds or so and you will see the air-pockets increase on the surface.Keep in mind that the timing will change or vary with the kind of skillet you are using, the chapati thickness and the intensity of the flame.Flip with spatula or tongs and roast the second side for about a minute. Flip again and you will see the second side cooked more than the first side with visible brown spots. With a clean folded cotton kitchen napkin or a spatula, begin to press the partially cooked roti on all sides and center. Pressing it evenly all over helps to puff up the roti. Keep on pressing all over, especially the flat portions, so that the entire roti gets puffed up well.If you prefer you can flip again and cook the second side too for some seconds if its looks under cooked. Transfer the soft and puffed roti in a roti-basket and spread some oil or ghee on top.Making ChapatiKeep the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook on medium-high to high heat for about 30 seconds or so until you see some air pockets all over. Flip the chapati and spread some oil all over while the second side is getting roasted. Cook the second side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.Flip again with a spatula. You will see that the second side is well roasted with some blisters and brown spots.Spread some oil on this cooked side. Roast the first side again for about 20 to 30 seconds.Remove and transfer to a chapati container or box. Keep covered. Make chapati with the rest of the dough in this manner.Serving and Storing SuggestionsServe roti or phulka or chapati with any Indian meal. Accompany it with vegetable or paneer curries, stir-fried or sautéed vegetables (sabji) or lentils (dals). Store any leftover dough in an air-tight container for just about 1 to 2 days. If the dough has darkened or has a weird smell, then throw it away. Store the flatbreads in a roti box or in a covered container for a few hours. Always cover with a tight lid, so that the flatbreads remain soft. Brushing or spreading with some oil or ghee on the roti, keeps them softer.

It is very important to soak the sago really well.Important: Please refrain from using un-soaked or under-soaked sabudana to avoid scalding or burns as they will burst and shatter in oil when frying.First optionally, using a colander or mesh strainer rinse 1 cup sabudana lightly twice draining all the water.Soak the sabudana or sago in water for 5 hours at least or overnight. I soaked the sago pearls overnight and by morning they had become soft.When properly soaked, the sabudana pearls will be tender without any hard center. When you press the pearls between your forefinger and thumb, they should get mashed easily with a floury moist texture on your fingers.If you feel some hardness in the center, then soak for some more time. Drain all the water really well from the soaked sabudana.There should not be any water logged in the soaked pearls. Water will make the patties moist and sticky. The patties will soak up a good amount of oil while frying making them loaded with oil. So drain the water really well. You can opt to gently and lightly press the soaked pearls in the strainer with a spoon or spatula. Or set aside the pearls in a strainer (keeping a bowl beneath) for some 20 to 30 minutes dripping of any extra water.After draining the water thoroughly transfer the sabudana in a mixing bowl and set aside.Cooking PotatoesScrub and rinse 4 medium-sized potatoes thoroughly in water first. 1. Stove-top pressure cooker:  Place the potatoes in a 3 litre cooker. Add water which just about covers the potatoes. Pressure cook potatoes for 10 to 12 minutes or 4 to 5 whistles on medium heat.When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, open the lid and check the potatoes. Pass a knife or fork through the center of the potatoes and it should slide easily without any resistance.2. Cooking in a pan: Take water and add peeled and chopped potatoes. The water should cover the potatoes. Add a 2 to 3 pinches of salt if preferred.Cover and simmer potatoes until fork tender. Drain the water really well. When the potatoes are tender, using a strainer, drain all the water. 3. For Instant Pot cooking: Place a trivet in the inner steel of your Instant Pot. Add 1.5 cups water. Place the rinsed potatoes on the trivet. Seal with the lid and position the valve to sealing. Press the manual/pressure cook button and set the time to 10 or 12 minutes with high pressure option.After you hear the beep when the pressure cooking is complete, wait for 5 minutes and then do a quick pressure release. Remove the potatoes with tongs and place them in a plate or tray. Check the potatoes to see if they are cooked tender with a fork or knife.Let the potatoes become warm. Later peel and then chop them or mash them.Roasting PeanutsOn a skillet or in a shallow pan, roast the groundnuts/peanuts till they become crisp and crunchy.Cool and then coarsely powder in a mortar-pestle or in a dry grinder. You can even make a fine powder.Making Sago MixtureAdd the mashed potatoes and coarsely ground roasted groundnuts to the sabudana in the mixing bowl.Add edible rock salt, cumin seeds, sugar, ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves and lemon juice to the sabudana . Mix the entire mixture very well.Now take some portion of the mixture in your hands and shape them into flat round vada or patty. Set aside.Repeat until you use up the entire dough mixture.Making Sabudana VadaHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai. Add a tiny ball made from the mixture.Fry it on medium flame. If this ball does not break while frying, then you are good to go. If it breaks, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of rajgira atta (or amaranth flour) to the mixture and mix well.Now gently place the vada in the oil. Keep the heat to medium or medium-high while frying. If the oil is warm, the vada will absorb a lot of oil and become soggy.Add the vada for frying depending on the size of the kadai. Do not crowd the kadai or pan.When one side gets golden, then only flip the vada. Otherwise, don't even touch as they might break if not cooked.Turn over a couple of times so as to fry the sabudana vada evenly. Fry until they are crisp and goldenRemove them with a slotted spoon. Place on kitchen paper towels to absorb excess oil. Fry the remaining batches of the patties this way.Serve Sabudana Vada hot or warm. Serving SuggestionsSabudana Vada can be made for fasting days or as an evening snack.It pairs well with coconut chutney, sweetened curd (just mix in some sugar), coriander chutney, tamarind chutney, or even tomato ketchup.Make Ahead OptionsFor prep ahead, boil and mash potatoes a day earlier, and roast and powder peanuts. Soaked sabudana can also be refrigerated after draining water.The patties can be shaped in advance and kept in the fridge. Any leftover mixture keeps well in the fridge for 1 to 2 days.",NutritionCalories: 107kcal | Carbohydrates: 17g | Protein: 2g | Fat: 4g | Saturated Fat: 0.5g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Sodium: 88mg | Potassium: 233mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 5IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.05mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.03mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 0.2mg | Vitamin C: 10mg | Vitamin E: 1mg | Vitamin K: 1µg | Calcium: 10mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 12µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 21mg | Phosphorus: 45mg | Zinc: 0.3mg

These pancakes are crispy and flaky from outside and soft from inside. This Green Onion Pancake recipe is made with whole wheat flour and is vegan.,10minutes,30minutes,40minutes,8.0,Scallion Pancakes,"Breakfast, Snacks","Chinese, World",Vegan,For Pancake Dough▢ 2 cups whole wheat flour (heaped) – 250 grams▢ ½ teaspoon salt or add as required▢ 2 tablespoons sunflower oil  – peanut oil or melted butter or any neutral flavored oil can be used instead▢ 1 cup water – boiling hot or add water as required,"Making Dough and Prepping ScallionsIn a mixing bowl take whole wheat flour and salt.Mix the salt with the flour.In a saucepan take 1.25 cups of water. Keep pan on a medium to medium-high heat for the water to boil.Let the water come to a boil.Add the boiling hot water in the flour in parts. First add ½ cup of water and mix with a spoon. At this point also add 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil or preferred neutral flavored oil.If required then add more hot water till the mixture starts to leave the sides of the bowl and comes together.I added 1 cup water to get a soft, supple and smooth dough. So go easy while adding water as the water absorption will depend on quality and texture of flour. If using only all-purpose flour, then you may just need to add ⅓ to ½ cup boiling hot water.Let the heat from the mixture become easier to handle and then begin to knead the dough. Knead to soft and supple dough and keep aside covered to rest.If the dough is sticky then add more flour. If the dough is dry then add more water. Mix and knead till all the water is absorbed and dough becomes soft. Cover and keep aside.Rinse the scallion or spring onion stalks in water a few times. Drain all the water. Then finely chop the spring onion greens. You can add a bit of whites too, but finely chop them or else they pop out from the the dough while rolling. Ensure to add more greens and less of the whites. You will need ⅔ to ¾ cup finely chopped scallions.Assembling & Making Green Onion PancakeTake the dough and roll it into a log shape of 10 to 11 inches. Slice the log in 7 to 8 equal parts. Keep the sliced dough circles covered in the same bowl in which the dough was kneaded.Take each part and roll it to a round shape first between your palms. Place it on a rolling board and flatten slightly with your fingers. Sprinkle some flour on the board as well as on the flattened dough.Roll to a large 8 by 10 inches rectangle with a rolling pin. Do not roll the dough too thin. Spread or brush toasted sesame oil all over the dough.Sprinkle the finely chopped spring onions. Also sprinkle a light pinch of salt all over the scallions. Adding salt can be skipped. At this step you can also add black pepper, green chillies for some spicy taste if you prefer. A pinch of sichuan pepper powder or Chinese 5 spice powder can also be sprinkled. For a Indian flavor, you can add a pinch of garam masala.From any side of the rolled dough, gently roll the stuffed dough. While rolling, tighten and then roll. Do not keep the roll loose. It should be a tight roll.Pinch and close the edges.Now hold one of the edges and begin to roll the dough around it in the shape of a spiral. Press and seal the last edge at the sides or beneath the spiral roll. This way make all spiral rolls from the dough and keep them covered.Take one stuffed spiral roll. Sprinkle some flour on the roll as well as on the rolling board.Roll to a slightly thick bread having a 5 to 6 inches diameter.Frying scallion pancakesHeat a skillet or pan – preferable a cast iron skillet or pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil and let it become hot. When the oil becomes hot, gently place the pancake in the oil. When one side is cooked and golden, flip over. Cook the second side.When the second side is fried and you see the crispy, crusty golden spots, flip over.Fry both sides till golden. You can fry a couple a times if the pancakes look undercooked. Fry on medium heat. You can fry for some more time to get a more crispy and crusty layer.Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry all the pancakes this way. For frying the next pancake, add ½ to 1 tablespoon oil in the pan.In a similar manner, roll the stuffed spiral dough and later fry the onion pancakes in the skillet in batches.Serve scallion pancakes hot with your favorite dipping sauce.",NutritionCalories: 287kcal | Carbohydrates: 22g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 2g | Monounsaturated Fat: 16g | Sodium: 294mg | Potassium: 132mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 0.3g | Vitamin A: 86IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.2mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin C: 2mg | Vitamin E: 7mg | Vitamin K: 19µg | Calcium: 17mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 19µg | Iron: 1mg | Magnesium: 43mg | Phosphorus: 110mg | Zinc: 1mg

Let it melt.When the ghee melts, add cashews. On a low heat fry the cashews until they become golden.Remove the golden fried cashews with a slotted spoon and then the raisins.Fry the raisins on a low heat. The raisins will soon start to swell up. Stir often while frying.Once the raisins swell, then remove them with a slotted spoon.Set the raisins aside with the fried cashews.Roasting semiya (stove-top method)In the same kadai add the broken semiya (seviyan or vermicelli).Mix well. Keep the flame to a low and begin to roast the semiya stirring often.Roast until the semiya becomes golden. Stir often while roasting semiya for even browning.Making semiya payasam (stove-top method)When the semiya has turned golden, add 3.5 cups milk. Milk can be chilled, warm, hot or at room temperature. For a thin payasam, add 4 cups milk. Do note that on cooling the payasam thickens. So add milk accordingly.Mix very well.Keep the heat to a low or medium-low and simmer until the semiya softens and are cooked well.Do stir at intervals so that the milk or semiya does not stick or get burnt at the bottom of the pan or kadai.Simmer until the vermicelli strands are softened nicely.Then add sugar.

Instant pot methodPress the sauté button of your IP. When you see the ""hot"" display on the screen, add ghee. Let it melt. Add the cashews and stirring often fry them until golden. Remove and set aside. Tip in the raisins and fry them until they swell. Remove and set aside.Add the vermicelli. Stirring non-stop roast them until golden. If the heat becomes too much, then press the sauté button to get the ""less"" option.Add milk and sugar. Give a good stir. Close the lid and position the pressure valve to sealing position. Press the porridge button and set the time to 7 minutes on high pressure. When the cooking is done (after you hear the Instant pot beep), give a quick pressure release after 10 minutes.Open the lid carefully. Add the cardamom powder and the fried cashews and raisins. Mix and stir. If the consistency is thin for your liking, then using the sauté function, simmer for a couple of minutes until the consistency thickens a bit. Serving SuggestionsSemiya payasam can be served hot, warm or chilled. When it comes to a room temperature, then you can refrigerate and serve later if you prefer that.On cooling and refrigerating payasam will thicken. So keep it to a slight flowing consistency when you want to serve it cold, so that it does not thicken too much. If at all the payasam has thickened too much, then simply add a bit of milk to thin the consistency.StorageIf there any leftovers, then refrigerate for 3 to 4 days in a covered container. I would not recommend freezing as the taste and texture changes and becomes way off. After refrigeration, you can reheat the payasam on low heat if you want to eat it hot or warm. Add some milk or water if the consistency has thickened too much.

I have used idli rice. You can also use short grained regular rice like sona masuri rice.Rinse all the ingredients for a couple of times in water. Drain and set aside.Next, in a separate bowl or pan or cup, take the thick poha. Rinse the poha once or twice with water.Strain and add the poha to the bowl containing rice, urad dal, methi seeds.Add 1.5 cups of water and soak all the ingredients for 5 to 6 hours.Later, drain the soaked water very well. Reserve the strained water. We will use this strained water for grinding. Or opt to use fresh water while grinding the rice and lentilsMaking sponge dosa batterNow add half of the soaked ingredients in a high speed grinder or blender. Depending on the size of the jar, you can grind in one lot or in batches.Add ½ cup water and grind very well. The rice grains can have a consistency of that like idli rawa.Pour this batter in a large bowl or pan. I ground in two batches. For the first round, I added ½ cup water and for the next batch I added ¼ cup water. I added a total of ¾ cup water while grinding. If the grinder becomes hot, then wait for it to cool down and then continue with the grinding.Add sugar to the batter in the bowl.Mix very well. Cover with a lid and let the batter ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more depending on the temperature conditions in your city.Before preparing dosa, add salt and baking soda. You can add the salt as per your taste.Mix very well. The soda should be evenly distributed in the dosa batter.In case if the batter looks thick, you can add some more water. I did add ¼ cup water before preparing the dosas. Mix very well after you add water.Cooking set dosa – Method 1Heat an iron tawa or skillet. In the center, spread some oil. For nonstick pan, you need not grease the pan with oil. The tawa has to be medium hot and not very hot. If very hot, the dosa gets too browned or can get burnt with uneven cooking. If the tawa is warm, then the dosa does not become soft and the air-pockets do not get formed on the dosa. While making these dosas, you can regulate the heat from low to medium.Take a ladle of the batter and gently pour it on the tawa. Just spread the batter very lightly to make a small and slightly thick dosa.Drizzle some oil on the sides as well as on the top. You can also top the set dosa with some grated carrots, beetroots, curry leaves, chopped onions and green chilies.When the base become golden and crisp, flip the dosa.When the second side also gets golden and crisp, lift the dosa with a spatula and serve. You can also place the set dosa in a warm casserole.Cooking Sponge Dosa – Method 2This is the usual method of cooking these dosas – first spread the batter and drizzle some oil on the sides and top.Lower the heat and cover the dosa with a lid.Remove the lid when the top is firm and done. Use any method that suits you to make these dosas. Prepare the dosas this way. If you have a large tawa, then you can make 2 to 3 set dosa at the same time.Serve with coconut chutney, vegetable korma, sambar or potato masala.",NutritionCalories: 354kcal | Carbohydrates: 63g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 8g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.4g | Monounsaturated Fat: 6g | Sodium: 369mg | Potassium: 78mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 0.3g | Vitamin A: 1IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 0.3mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 0.05mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 2mg | Vitamin B6: 0.1mg | Vitamin C: 0.4mg | Vitamin E: 3mg | Vitamin K: 0.4µg | Calcium: 20mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 118µg | Iron: 3mg | Magnesium: 22mg | Phosphorus: 79mg | Zinc: 1mg

Try my authentic Punjabi recipe of this scrumptious Shakkarpare snack that you can literally munch on, any time!",5minutes,45minutes,50minutes,450.0,grams,"Snacks, Sweets",North Indian,Vegetarian,For the dough▢ 240 grams whole wheat flour  (atta) or 2 cups whole wheat flour▢ 2 tablespoons Ghee▢ ½ cup water or add as required,"Making Shakarpara DoughTake whole wheat flour in a mixing bowl or pan. Add 2 tablespoons of ghee. The ghee should be at room temperature and in a semi solid state. Instead of whole wheat flour you can also take all purpose flour and oil instead of ghee.With your fingertips, mix the ghee with the flour very well.When you press the flour and ghee mixture in your palm, you should get a flour lump like shown in the picture below. The mixture should be able to hold itself together without falling apart.Now add water in parts. Depending on the quality of flour, you can add less or more water. I added ½ cup water.Begin to knead the dough. Add water as required. If you use all-purpose flour, you will need less water.Knead to a firm semi soft dough. Neither too soft nor too hard. The dough should be not soft like the dough we make for chapatis.Divide the dough into three equal parts. Cover with a lid.Take one part and roll into a thick paratha of 7 to 8 inches in diameter.With a knife make squares or diamond shapes on the rolled dough, by slicing criss cross or vertically-horizontally.Frying ShakkarpareHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Test the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough in the pan. This small piece of the dough should come up gradually and quickly on the surface. If it comes slowly, the oil has a lower temperature and if it comes up too quickly, the oil has high temperature. I fried on medium heat. You can regulate the heat while frying by increasing or decreasing it.Slid the cut diamond shaped dough in the medium hot oil.Depending on the pan size, you can add more or less. But do make sure that there is some space while frying them.When the shakkarpara are crisp and light golden, turn over and fry.Keep on frying them and turning as and when needed for even frying.Fry till all of them turn golden.Remove with a slotted spoon and drain shakkar pare on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.Continue to prepare the shakkarpara and fry them as mentioned in the above steps.When you are begin frying the last batch, you can start preparing the sugar syrup. Let all the shakkarpara come to room temperature, before you add them in the sugar syrup.Making sugar syrupTake 1 cup sugar in another kadai or pan. Add ½ cup water.Keep the pan on a low to medium heat. Stir so that the sugar dissolves.Continue cooking the sugar syrup till it starts bubbling and getting sticky. A suggestion here is to add some saffron strands in sugar syrup to get orange or yellow colored shakkarpara.Simmer till you get a 2 to 3 thread consistency in the syrup. To check the consistency, take a bit of the syrup in a spoon. Let it become warm and then take the syrup between your forefinger and thumb. Press and separate the fingers. You should see two to three threads in the sugar syrup.Once the two to three thread consistency is reached, quickly add all the shakkarpara in the syrup.Briskly stir and toss well, so that all the shakkarpara are coated with the sugar syrup.The sugar syrup crystallizes soon, so mix very well and be quick.Now take all the shakkarpara in a plate and allow them to come at room temperature. The sugar syrup will crystallize on cooling.Once all of them cool down, store shakkarpara in an air-tight box or jar.

You can also use a cast iron or steel pan. But make sure they are well-seasoned.With a paper tissue or a small piece of kitchen towel dipped in oil, grease the pan. For the nonstick pan you can skip greasing with oil. But if you feel the wrappers are sticking then grease or brush the pan evenly with oil.Now lift the pan above the stovetop burner.

Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges. If you are using square wrappers, then do check the recipe video in the post to see the wrapping and folding.Wrapping Method 2Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it. While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break.

Add 3 to 4 tablespoons more water or as required while kneading the dough. I added about a total of 9.5 tablespoons of water. Addition of water will depend on the texture and quality of rice flour. So add in portions.Tip – avoid making a soft dough as then it becomes difficult to shape and lift the thattai rounds. Do not make the dough too hard as then thattai will not be crisp. It will have a hard and dense texture. Also check the taste of dough and add more salt if needed. Cover and keep aside.Assembling and Shaping thattaiTake a butter paper or parchment paper or a ziplock bag or a clean cotton napkin. Grease the butter paper or parchment paper with some oil. Keep oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Keep the heat to medium or medium-high.Make small balls from the dough.Place a dough ball on the greased parchment paper.Press and flatten thattai with your fingertips to a thin round. Spread some oil on your fingers while flattening them. Do not make them too thin and flat as then you cannot lift them.Make 5 to 6 thattai on the parchment paper. Check the temperature of oil by adding a tiny piece of the thattai dough. If it comes up swiftly on top, the oil is hot enough.Frying thattaiLift the prepared thattai round gently from the paper.Gently place in the hot oil.Begin to fry thattai on a medium or medium-high heat. When one side is crisp, then flip over each thattai with a slotted or spider spoon.Fry the second side till crisp. You can flip a couple of times to get an even golden color and crispness.Fry thattai till crispy and crunchy. When the oil stops bubbling and sizzling, this means the thattai is fried well.Remove fried thattai with a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper towels.When frying the first batch of thattai, shape the second batch and keep them ready. However do keep an eye on the batch of the thattai that is being fried. This way make all thattai in batches.As soon as the thattai cools at room temperature, place them in a steel box or jar.

Strain the rice in a colander or sieve. You can also gently rinse cooked rice in water so that they stop cooking and don't stick to each other. Cover the cooked rice and set aside until the rice cools completely. You can even refrigerate rice with a covered lid for 30 minutes. Chopping veggiesWhen the cooked rice is cooling, chop the veggies finely and keep aside. Remember to chop the french beans very finely. They take more time to cook than other veggies. You can also blanch them first and then cook. Another option is to add the beans first and then add the other vegetables.Making veg fried riceHeat oil in a wok or a pan. First add the star anise and fry for a few seconds or until the oil becomes fragrant.Add the garlic, ginger and sauté for some seconds. No need to brown the garlic.

Soak the rice in 1 cup of water for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes drain the rice and set aside.When the rice is soaking prep all the veggies and other ingredients. Set aside.Cooking riceTake a deep bottomed pan. Add water and heat the water on a high flame.When the water becomes hot, add the salt and following spices: tej patta, green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom, cinnamon, strands of mace.Bring the water to a boil. Then add the soaked basmati rice.Just gently stir with a spoon or fork, after you add the soaked rice.Do not reduce the flame and continue to cook the rice grains.The rice has to be ¾ᵗʰ cooked. The grains should have a slight bite to them when cooked. The rice should not be fully cooked. Drain the rice in a colander. Gently fluff and keep aside.Making vegetable curry/gravyIn a 2-litre pressure cooker or a pan, heat ghee.

For cooking in a pan, add ¾ cup water.  Season with salt and mix again.Pressure cook for 1 whistle on 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat. If cooking in a pot, then cook until the vegetables are tender. Don’t over cook the vegetables.Warm 4 to 5 tablespoons milk in a microwave or in a small pan on the stove top. Add ¼ teaspoon of saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.When the pressure settles down on its own, remove the lid and check the gravy. If the vegetables are under cooked, then keep the cooker on the stove top and simmer the biryani gravy without the lid, till the vegetables are tender. If there is too much of water or stock in the gravy, then simmer until some of the water evaporates and dries up. Note that the vegetable gravy should have a medium or slightly thick consistency and should not be watery.Now add cashews, raisins and almonds (blanched or raw) to the vegetable gravy. Mix and stir. Set aside. Do a taste test and check the salt in the vegetable gravy. Add more if needed.Assembling and layeringNow in a thick bottomed pan, layer half portion of the vegetable gravy first.Then layer half portion of the semi-cooked rice.Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander leaves (cilantro), mint leaves and saffron milk.Layer the remaining vegetable gravy.Layer the last portion of the rice. Sprinkle the remaining coriander leaves, mint leaves, and saffron infused milk on the top. Sprinkle rose water or kewra water. You can make 2 layers or 4 layers like I have done. But do note that rice should be the top layer and the vegetable gravy should be the bottom layer. Dum cooking Now seal and secure the pot with an aluminium foil. Then cover with a lid. You can also seal the pan with a moist cotton cloth and then cover with a lid.Take a tava/griddle/skillet and heat it on medium flame.When the tawa become hot, then lower the flame.

There should be no liquids at the bottom. If there are liquids, then continue to dum cook for some more time. After dum cooking, give a resting time of 5 to 7 minutes and later serve the Hyderabadi Veg Dum Biryani. Serving SuggestionsWhile serving, make sure you equally serve the vegetables as well as the rice.There are various sides that pair best with a Veg Dum Biryani. Biryani is usually accompanied with a raita (yogurt dip).

Take all of the finely chopped vegetables in a mixing bowl. You can opt to grate or shred the vegetables.Add the chopped onions, green chilies and ginger.Add all the ground spice powders including salt. Mix everything very well.Now add cup besan (gram flour).Combine and mix thoroughly. Set aside this mixture for 5 minutes.Add water in small portions to make a thick flowing batter. I added ¼ cup water.Note that with the kind of vegetables you use, the amount of water will vary. For leafy greens and watery vegetables, add very little water or you may not need to add any water at all.Deep frying Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or frying pan. When the oil becomes hot, then drop spoonfuls of the batter in the oil. Fry the pakora on medium to medium-high heat.Use any neutral flavored oil with a high smoking point to deep-fry. When one side of the pakora firms up, looks cooked and is light golden, turn over gently and fry the other side.Turn over a couple of times and fry the vegetable pakora until they are crisp and golden.Once done, then remove them with a slotted spoon draining as much oil as possible in the pan. Place on kitchen paper towels to remove extra oil. Fry the pakoras in batches this way.Serve vegetable pakora with any chutney or sauce of your choice. I usually prepare mint chutney or coriander chutney to serve with them. You can also have them with roti or bread or sandwich them between bread slices.They make for an excellent evening tea time snack. Best to have them hot with a cup of tea and an accompanying green chutney of your choice.Serving SuggestionsServe mix vegetable pakora with any chutney or sauce of your choice like Mint Chutney, Green Chutney, Coconut Chutney, Cilantro chutney or Tomato Ketchup.These crisp veggie fritters also make for a nice evening snack with a side of Masala Chai or Ginger Chai or even Filter Coffee.They can also be had with Roti or with Bread. You can also sandwich them between bread slices and have as an evening tea time snack.Storage and LeftoversPakoras are best served hot. I suggest to fry a portion from the batter as much as you need. Refrigerate the leftover batter in a covered bowl or container for a few hours or up-to a day. Stored, leftover pakora looses their crispiness and do not taste the same like piping hot pakoras.",NutritionCalories: 206kcal | Carbohydrates: 14g | Protein: 4g | Fat: 15g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 1mg | Sodium: 420mg | Potassium: 270mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 2038IU | Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): 1mg | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 1mg | Vitamin B3 (Niacin): 1mg | Vitamin B6: 1mg | Vitamin C: 20mg | Vitamin E: 6mg | Vitamin K: 17µg | Calcium: 20mg | Vitamin B9 (Folate): 17µg | Iron: 5mg | Magnesium: 9mg | Phosphorus: 19mg | Zinc: 1mg

Add water and stir well till smooth.Add ginger-green chili paste, turmeric powder, asafoetida and salt.If using fresh yogurt, then to add the sourness, add about ½ tsp of lemon juice.Add the gram flour/besan. With a wired whisk, keep on stirring and mixing till all the lumps are dissolved and you get a smooth batter. There should be no lumps in the batter. You can also use a hand held beater to mix the batter.Spread oil on plates or boards or tray. Large steel lids or thalis work very well. You can also use the back of a large baking tray or your kitchen counter top.Also mix the chopped coriander leaves and grated coconut. Keep aside.Pour the batter in a sauce pan or a broad frying pan. Switch on the stove top and keep the flame to the lowest. Begin to stir.Keep on stirring when the khandvi batter is getting heated up.

So you have to stir continuously.Do a plate test when the batter has thickened well.Spread a few teaspoons of the batter on a greased plate. Let it cool a bit and then begin to roll. If you are unable to roll, then the batter needs to be cooked more.The final consistency of the khandvi batter is shown in pic 17 below. It took me 17 minutes to get the correct consistency on a low flame. The timing will vary depending on the intensity of the flame, the thickness/thinness of the pan and the size of the pan. Just do the plate test and when you can form the rolls, then the khandvi batter is ready. If the batter becomes too thick, then it becomes difficult to spread and you don’t get thin layers in the rolls. In this case, still spread the batter. You will get thick slices, but still they taste good.making khandvi rollsQuickly pour about ½ to ⅔ cup of batter on a large plate and spread thinly & evenly with a spatula. You have to be quick with the remaining batter too. Since even a bit of cooling and the batter becomes likes blob, difficult to spread.Allow to cool and then sprinkle the coconut + coriander leaves mixture sparingly. You can also skip this stuffing part and directly garnish with the coconut and coriander once you temper the khandvi rolls.Cut into equal sized strips.Gently roll each strip tightly. Then place them in a serving tray or plate.if the tray or plate is large, then you will get large rolls. In this case after you finish rolling half, just cut horizontally and make a second roll.Arrange the khandvi rolls next to each other or stack them up neatly in a plate or tray.tempering (seasoning) for khandviHeat oil and crackle the mustard seeds.Then add curry leaves, green chilies and fry for a few seconds.Add the sesame seeds and when they change color & crackle, pour the hot tempering mixture along with the oil on the khandvi rolls evenly.You can garnish it with some more coconut and coriander leaves, if you prefer.
